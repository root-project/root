<h3>I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add support for the Chirp filesystem.  To configure and build, chirp 3.2.2 must be installed.</li>
<li>When a TFile object is deleted, make sure that CINT also 'removes' any global variables that might point to it.</li>
<li>Fix support for the automatic addition to the current directory (for TTree and TH1 for example) in TKey::Read(TObject*).</li>
<li>In TKey, properly handle error in the I/O routines.</li>
<li>Explicitly check the validity of the zipped buffer before calling R__unzip, this allow for better error recovery.</li>
<li>When double checking whether a checksum difference is sustantial, ignore the std namespace.   Use CompareContent also in the case of where 
the class is versioned but the 'current' streamerInfo has not yet been built.</li>
<li>Prevent the I/O engine from mistakenly applying schema evolution to the TObject::fBits.</li>
<li>Make sure that when a streamer info of a base class is used to stream memberwise that is always not-optimized. If the StreamerInfo on file 
has the same version as the StreamerInfo in memory but the one on file need to be 'not optimized' while the one in memory is not yet built, make 
sure it will not be optimized.</li>
<li>Fix the reading of empty collection of object when reading without the library.</li>
<li>If the sequence of actions for streaming member-wise is not created correctly (i.e. where fReadMemberWise was null previously),
we know explicitly issue a Fatal error:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
Fatal in &lt;ReadSequence&gt;: The sequence of actions to read AliESDVertex:7 member-wise was not initialized.
aborting
</pre></li>
<li>Add new optional parameter maxbuf to TXMLEngine::ParseFile() allowing the specification of the XML file size to be parsed. This fixes issue #78864.</li>
<li><h4>MakeProject</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Add support for the case when the requested project/files in path that in not under the current directory</li>
  <li>Generate the code/dictonary only for pair type that do not already have a dictionary</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
