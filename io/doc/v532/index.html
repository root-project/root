<h3>I/O Libraries</h3>
<h4>gDirectory</h4>
gDirectory is now a thread local!

The value of gDirectory and gFile are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class.  The access is made transparent via a CPP macro.

<br/>Note: Whenever a thread has an associated TThread object, the value of gDirectory is now thread local, i.e. all modifications direct or indirect of gDirectory will not be seen by the other thread.   In particular this means that several I/O operations (including TDirectory::Write) are thread safe (<b>as long as all the required TClass and TStreamerInfo has been previously setup</b>).
<br/>Note: This model does <b>not</b> support sharing TFile amongst threads (i.e. a TFile must be accessed from exactly <em>one</em> thread).   This means that whenever a TFile's control is <i>passed</i> from a thread to another, the code must explicitly reset gDirectory to another value or there is a risk for this gDirectory to point to a stale pointer if the other thread deletes the TFile object.  A TFile deletion will only affect the value of the local gDirectory and gFile.

<h4>TMemFile</h4>
Introduce <tt>TMemFile</tt> and update <tt>TFileMerger</tt> to support incremental merges.
<p/>
Add new tutorials ( <tt>net/treeClient.C</tt> + <tt>net/fastMergeServer.C</tt> )
demonstrating how a <tt>TMemFile</tt> can be used to do parallel merge
from many client. ( <tt>TMemFile</tt> still needs to be better integrated
with <tt>TMessage</tt> and <tt>TSocket</tt>).
<p/>
The new <tt>TMemFile</tt> class support the <tt>TFile</tt> interface but only store
the information in memory.   This version is limited to <tt>32MB</tt>.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TMessage mess;
   ... 
   mess->ReadFastArray(scratch,length);
   transient = new TMemFile("hsimple.memroot",scratch,length);
</pre>
will copy the content of 'scratch' into the in-memory buffer
created by/for the <tt>TMemFile</tt>.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   TMemFile *file = new TMemFile("hsimple.memroot","RECREATE");
</pre>
Will create an empty in-memory of (currently fixed) size <tt>32MB</tt>.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   file->ResetAfterMerge(0);
</pre>
Will reset the objects in the <tt>TDirectory</tt> list of objects
so that they are ready for more data accumulations (i.e.
returns the data to 0 but keep the customizations).
<h4>Other</h4>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the new function <tt>TFileMerger::IncrementalMerge</tt> will
will <tt>Merge</tt> the list of file _with_ the content of the output
file (if any).   This allows make several successive <tt>Merge</tt>
into the same <tt>TFile</tt> object.
</li><li>
Introduce non-static version of <tt>TFile::Cp</tt> allows the copy of
an existing <tt>TFile</tt> object.
</li><li>
Introduce new explicit interface for providing reseting 
capability after a merge.  If a class has a method with 
the name and signature:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   void ResetAfterMerge(TFileMergeInfo*);
</pre>
it will be used by a <tt>TMemFile</tt> to reset its objects after
a merge operation has been done.
<p/>
If this method does not exist, the <tt>TClass</tt> will use
a method with the name and signature:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   void Reset(Optiont_t *);
</pre>
</li><li>
<tt>TClass</tt> now provides a quick access to these merging 
function via <tt>TClass::GetResetAfterMerge</tt>.   The wrapper function
is automatically created by rootcint and can be installed
via <tt>TClass::SetResetAfterMerge</tt>.   The wrapper function should have
the signature/type <tt>ROOT::ResetAfterMergeFunc_t</tt>:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   void (*)(void *thisobj, TFileMergeInfo*);
</pre>
<tt>ResetAfterMerge</tt> functions were added to the following classes:
<tt>TDirectoryFile</tt>, <tt>TMemFile</tt>, <tt>TTree</tt>, <tt>TChain</tt>, <tt>TBranch</tt>, <tt>TBranhcElement</tt>, 
<tt>TBranchClones</tt>, <tt>TBranchObject</tt> and <tt>TBranchRef</tt>.
</li>
</ul>
