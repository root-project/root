<h3>I/O</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implement proxy support in TWebFile. The proxy URL can be sprcified either
via TWebFile::SetProxy() or via the shell variable http_proxy, as is being
used by wget, e.g.:
<pre>   export http_proxy=http://pcsalo.cern.ch:3128</pre>
To bypass the proxy, the TWebFile ctor (or via TFile::Open()) supports the
option "NOPROXY".</li>
<li>Add support for streaming std::bitset STL containers</li>
<li>Extend the checks done in case of a StreamerInfo checksum mismatch to
avoid spurrious failures (for example because of the various possible
type names for STL containers) and to report details on the nature of
the mismatch: explicit list missing base classese, missing data members
or the actual differences in type or comments.
For example:

<pre>Warning in <TStreamerInfo::CompareContent>: The following data member of the on-file layout version 2 of class 'Tdata' differs from the in-memory layout version 2:
   double mydouble; //
vs
   double mydouble_two; //
Warning in <TStreamerInfo::CompareContent>: The following data member of the in-memory layout version 2 of class 'Tdata' is missing from the on-file layout version 2:
   int more; //
Warning in <TStreamerInfo::CompareContent>: The following data member of the in-memory layout version 2 of class 'Tdata' is missing from the on-file layout version 2:
   int three; //
</pre>
</li>
<li>Upgrade MakeProject to be able to handle ROOT files created by for ATLAS.</li>
<li>Allow user to provide a custom reallocator when the TBuffer is being passed
memory.  If the TBuffer does not own the memory __and__ no custom memory
reallocator has been set, a Fatal error will be issued:
<pre>Fatal in <TBufferFile::Expand>: Failed to expand the data buffer because TBuffer does not own it and no custom memory reallocator was provided.</pre></li>
<li>Re-allow reading empty vector&lt; long double &gt;, however long double is <b>still</b> not supported.</li>
<li>Upgrade TSQLFile to properly work with MySQL on MacOS.</li>
<li>Update to the CollectionProxyInfo interface to insure the proper creation of iterator over std containers on all platforms.</li>
<li>In XML and SQL output, use %e format to write float and double:
  <ul>
  <li>Conversion from float/double to string per default performed with "%e" (exponential) format.</li>
  <li>Format can be configured with SetFloatFormat methods that one can specify precision, width arguments of printf call.</li>
  <li>sscanf works as before - "%f" accpet both exponential and decimal format.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
