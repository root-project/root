// Format of FreeSegments record, release 6.22.06.  It is never compressed.
// It is probably not accessed by its key, but from its offset given in the file header.
//
// If any *individual* free segments refer to bytes beyond 2000000000,
// their fFirst/fLast have 8 bytes, not 4 and 1000 is added to the TFree Version.
//
// Some free segment records may be 32 bit while others are 64 bit.
// ----------TKey---------------

//                                  (e.g. a free segment that is 1 byte long would have fFirst == fLast)
//       ....           Sequentially, Version, fFirst and fLast of additional free segments.
//       ....           There is always one free segment beginning at file end and ending before 2000000000.
//       ....           If the file size is larger than 2000000000, the last segment ends with 4000000000.
