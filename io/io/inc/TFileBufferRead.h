/**
 * Add a buffering layer in front of a TFile.
 *
 * This divides the file into 128MB chunks; the first time a byte from a chunk
 * is accessed, the whole chunk is downloaded to a temporary file on disk.  A
 * file chunk is only downloaded if accessed.
 *
 * This is *not* meant to be a cache: as soon as the TFile is closed, the buffer
 * is removed.  This means repeated access to the same file will still cause it
 * to be downloaded multiple times.
 *
 * Rather, the focus of this buffer is to hide the effects of network latency.
 *
 * Implementation is based on a similar approach from CMSSW:
 * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X/Utilities/StorageFactory/src/LocalCacheFile.cc
