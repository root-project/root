\class ROOT::Experimental::RFile
\ingroup RFile
\brief An interface to read from, or write to, a ROOT file, as well as performing other common operations.

## When and why should you use RFile

RFile is a modern and minimalistic interface to ROOT files, both local and remote, that can be used instead of TFile
when the following conditions are met:
- you want a simple interface that makes it easy to do things right and hard to do things wrong;
- you only need basic Put/Get operations and don't need the more advanced TFile/TDirectory functionalities;
- you want more robustness and better error reporting for those operations;
- you want clearer ownership semantics expressed through the type system rather than having objects "automagically"
  handled for you via implicit ownership of raw pointers.

RFile doesn't try to cover the entirety of use cases covered by TFile/TDirectory/TDirectoryFile and is not
a 1:1 replacement for them. It is meant to simplify the most common use cases and make them easier to handle by
minimizing the amount of ROOT-specific quirks and conforming to more standard C++ practices.

## Ownership model

RFile handles ownership via smart pointers, typically std::unique_ptr.

When getting an object from the file (via RFile::Get) you get back a unique copy of the object. Calling `Get` on the
same object twice produces two independent clones of the object. The ownership over that object is solely on the caller
and not shared with the RFile. Therefore, the object will remain valid after closing or destroying the RFile that
generated it. This also means that any modification done to the object are **not** reflected to the file automatically:
to update the object in the file you need to write it again (via RFile::Overwrite).

RFile::Put and RFile::Overwrite are the way to write objects to the file. Both methods take a const reference to the
object to write and don't change the ownership of the object in any way. Calling Put or Overwrite doesn't guarantee that
the object is immediately written to the underlying storage: to ensure that, you need to call RFile::Flush (or close the
file).

## Directories

Differently from TFile, the RFile class itself is not also a "directory". In fact, there is no RDirectory class at all.

Directories are still an existing concept in RFile (since they are a concept in the ROOT binary format),
but they are usually interacted with indirectly, via the use of filesystem-like string-based paths. If you Put an object
in an RFile under the path "path/to/object", "object" will be stored under directory "to" which is in turn stored under
directory "path". This hierarchy is encoded in the ROOT file itself and it can provide some optimization and/or
conveniencies when querying objects.

For the most part, it is convenient to think about RFile in terms of a key-value storage where string-based paths are
used to refer to arbitrary objects. However, given the hierarchical nature of ROOT files, certain filesystem-like
properties are applied to paths, for ease of use: the '/' character is treated specially as the directory separator;
multiple '/' in a row are collapsed into one (since RFile doesn't allow directories with empty names).

At the moment, RFile doesn't allow getting directories via Get, nor writing ones via Put (this may change in the
future).

## Sample usage
Opening an RFile (for writing) and writing an object to it:
~~~{.cpp}
auto rfile = ROOT::RFile::Recreate("my_file.root");
auto myObj = TH1D("h", "h", 10, 0, 1);
rfile->Put(myObj.GetName(), myObj);
~~~

Opening an RFile (for reading) and reading an object from it:
~~~{.cpp}
auto rfile = ROOT::RFile::Open("my_file.root");
auto myObj = file->Get<TH1D>("h");
~~~
