/**
 * \class RRawFile RRawFile.hxx
 * \ingroup IO
 *
 * The RRawFile provides read-only access to local and remote files. Data can be read either byte-wise or line-wise.
 * The RRawFile base class provides line-wise access and buffering for byte-wise access. Derived classes provide the
 * low-level read operations, e.g. from a local file system or from a web server. The RRawFile is used for non-ROOT
 * RDataSource implementations and for RNTuple.
 *
 * Files are addressed by URL consisting of a transport protocol part and a location, like file:///path/to/data
 * If the transport protocol part and the :// separator are missing, the default protocol is local file. Files are
 * opened when required (on reading, getting file size) and closed on object destruction.
 *
 * RRawFiles manage system respources and are therefore made non-copyable. They can be explicitly cloned though.
