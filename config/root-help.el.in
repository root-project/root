;;; Commentary:
;;
;;    The Emacs Lisp library `root-help.el' provides a number of
;;    function to ease the development of ROOT based classes and
;;    projects.
;;
;;    I'll bet you, that after using this for a while, you'll never
;;    want to go back to using a normal terminal for running ROOT -
;;    unless you're a Vi-lover of course :-).
;;
;;  Installation
;;   
;;    To use the Emacs Lisp library, download `root-help.el' and put
;;    it somewhere Emacs looks for Lisp libraries.  For people who
;;    have system operator privileges, the following directories are
;;    good candidates:
;;   
;;       /usr/share/emacs/site-lisp
;;       /usr/share/emacs/<version>/site-lisp
;;       /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
;;       /usr/local/share/emacs/<version>/site-lisp
;;       /usr/lib/emacs/site-lisp
;;       /usr/lib/emacs/<version>/site-lisp
;;       /usr/local/lib/emacs/site-lisp
;;       /usr/local/lib/emacs/<version>/site-lisp
;;      
;;    where `<version>' is the version number of the Emacs you're
;;    using.
;;   
;;    For normal users, one should create the directory 
;;
;;       ${HOME}/share/emacs/site-lisp
;;   
;;    And add the line below to `~/.emacs':
;;   
;;       (setq load-path (cons "~/share/emacs/site-lisp" load-path))
;;   
;;    In any case, users that want to use the ROOT Emacs Lisp helper
;;    functions should add the line below to their `~/.emacs':
;;   
;;       (require 'root-help)
;;
;;    System operators may have some way of providing the library
;;    system wide.  For example on Debian systems, one can add the
;;    file `/etc/emacs/site-start.d/50root-help.el' with the contents
;;   
;;       (require 'root-help)
;;   
;;    and the library functions will be available system wide. See
;;    also your Emacs manual for more information.
;;   
;;  Functions
;;   
;;    All the functions in the library are invoked by typing
;;   
;;       M-x <function>
;;   
;;    where `M-x' means "Meta key down and then `x'", where the Meta
;;    key is usually defined to `Alt' and `Esc', and `<function>' is
;;    the function to be invoked.
;;   
;;    No key-bindings have been setup per default, but this is easily
;;    done using the customisation support of Emacs.  Alternatively
;;    one can define key-bindings in ones `~/.emacs' file.  For
;;    example, one could bind the functions in C++ mode like this:
;;
;;       (defun root-c++-mode-hook ()
;;         "Hook for C++ mode - binding ROOT functions"
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crc"  'root-class)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crh"  'root-header-skel)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crs"  'root-source-skel)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-cri"  'root-include-header)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crm"  'root-main)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crl"  'root-insert-linkdef)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crp"  'root-insert-pragma)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crx"  'root-shell)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crg"  'root-send-line-to-root)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crr"  'root-send-region-to-root)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crb"  'root-send-buffer-to-root)
;;         (define-key c++-mode-map "\C-crf"  'root-execute-file))
;;       (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'root-c++-mode-hook)
;;   
;;    root-class [NAME SCOPE INCDIR SRCDIR]  
;; 	Make two new files for a ROOT based class.  All arguments are
;; 	optional, and if not provided, the user will be prompted for
;; 	them.  `NAME' is the name of the class.  This can not be left
;; 	blank.  `SCOPE' the preprocessor scope for header guards, or
;; 	`ROOT' if left blank.  `INCDIR' is where the declaration file
;; 	will live, defaults to current directory.  `SRCDIR' is where
;; 	the definition file will live, defaults to current directory.
;;
;;    root-header-skel [SCOPE BASE DSCR] 
;; 	Insert a skeleton for a ROOT based class The class name is
;; 	derived from the current buffers file name, if possible,
;; 	otherwise the user is prompted for it.  All arguments are
;; 	optional.  If not specified, the user will be prompted for it.
;;
;; 	`SCOPE' is the preprocessor scope for header guards, and
;; 	`BASE' is the possible base class, and `DSCR' a short doc
;;      string 
;;
;;    root-source-skel [SCOPE DSCR]
;; 	Insert a skeleton for a ROOT based class The class name is
;; 	derived from the current buffers file name, if possible,
;; 	otherwise the user is prompted for it.  All arguments are
;; 	optional.  If not specified, the user will be prompted for it.
;;
;; 	`SCOPE' is the preprocessor scope for header guards, and DSCR
;;      a short description
;;
;;    root-include-header [HEADER SCOPE] 
;; 	Insert an `#include' statement with guards for a ROOT class
;;
;; 	`HEADER' is the name of the class to include a header for, and
;; 	`SCOPE' is the optional scope, which defaults to `ROOT'.  If
;; 	not given, `HEADER' is read from the minibuffer with
;; 	completion. The completion is based on the file names found in
;; 	`root-include-directory'.
;;        
;;    root-main
;; 	Insert a skeleton for a ROOT based program Two function will
;; 	be created - one which has the name of the current buffer with
;; 	out extensions, and which the user is to fill in, and a `main'
;; 	function that calls this function.  Like this, we can use the
;; 	file for both interactive input, due to use of guards, and as
;; 	a program.
;;
;; 	The user will be prompted for whether graphics is needed or
;; 	not.  If yes, then a `TApplication' object is created in the
;; 	`main' function.
;;
;;    root-insert-linkdef
;; 	Insert lines appropriate for a linkdef file into current
;; 	buffer
;;
;; 	The user will be prompted for classes to add to the linkdef
;; 	file.  An empty string ends the input.
;;
;;    root-insert-pragma [NAME NEED-PLUS] 
;; 	Insert a pragma linkdef line for a class All arguments are
;; 	optional.  If not given, the user will be prompted for them.
;; 	`NAME' is the name of class, and if `NEED-PLUS' is non-nil, an
;; 	`+' will be appended to the class name line.
;;
;;    root-shell [SCRIPT]
;; 	Start an interactive ROOT session in a buffer The executable
;; 	stored in `root-executable' is executed with the arguments
;; 	`root-executable-args'.  If Emacs is running in a non-graphics
;; 	terminal (like a VT100) `root-executable-args-nographics' is
;; 	passed to the executable.
;;
;;      If the optional [SCRIPT] argument is given, it should be a
;;      file name that will be inserted into the session on startup. 
;;
;;    root-send-line-to-root
;;      Sends the current line to an interactive ROOT session.  If no
;;      session currently exists, one will be created.  The point is
;;      moved down one line, and left in the current window (buffer). 
;;      You can use this to step throught a script.
;;
;;    root-send-region-to-root [START END]
;;      Sends the contents of the current region to an interactive
;;      ROOT session.  If no session exists, then one will be
;;      created.  The point is left in the current window. 
;;
;;    root-send-buffer-to-root
;;      Sends the current buffer to an interactive ROOT session.  
;;      If no session exists, then one will be created.  The point is
;;      left in the current window.  If the buffer has an associated
;;      file, and it has been modified since the last save, then the
;;      user will be prompted for whether she wants to save the buffer
;;      or not. 
;; 
;;  Customisation
;;   
;;    The library depends on a number of variables that the user may
;;    customise using Emacs' regular customisation support.  All the
;;    customisation is in the sub-group `Root' of the group
;;    `Programming - Tools'
;;   
;;    root-include-directory
;; 	Where the ROOT headers reside.  If the `ROOTSYS' environment
;; 	variable is set, this defaults to `${ROOTSYS}/include',
;; 	otherwise to `/usr/include/root'
;;     
;;    root-executable
;; 	Full path to the ROOT interactive executable. If the `ROOTSYS'
;; 	environment variable is set, this defaults to
;; 	`${ROOTSYS}/bin/root', otherwise to `/usr/bin/root'
;;     
;;    root-executable-args
;; 	Arguments to pass to `root-executable'.  Per default this is
;; 	empty.
;;      
;;    root-executable-args-nographics
;; 	Arguments to pass to `root-executable' in case Emacs is
;; 	running in a non-graphics environment, like a VT100 terminal
;; 	or similar.  Per default this is set to `"-l -b"'
;;
;;    root-execute-file
;;      Execute the current buffer in an interactive ROOT session. 
;;      
;;      If no session exists, then one will be created.  With a prefix
;;      argument, the user is asked to provide a file name.
