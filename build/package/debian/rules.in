# Rules file for ROOT packages for Debian GNU/Linux

# Uncomment this to turn on verbose mode. 
#export DH_VERBOSE=1

# This is the debhelper compatability version to use.

# This has to be exported to make some magic below work.

# Order of the packages are important for when we move files around
#
BUILDPREFIX = $(shell pwd)/debian/tmp

#
# Some notes about this target:
#
# * We build the full ROOT system here. 
# * See README.Debian for thoughts about the configure options. 
# * I've got a dual-processor machine, so I use -j3 for make
# * Uncomment the lines with "make changleog" to install the full
#   upstream changelog. This is only possible if you have CVS access
#   to the main repository at :pserver:cvs@root.cern.ch:/user/cvs 
#   (password is "cvs")

# Some notes about this target:
#
# * We use the maintainer-clean target rather then the clean target,
#   since this is much more thourogh, and we really need a clean
#   source directory for the patches
# * We remove the Changelog file if it was created
#
clean:
	dh_testdir
	dh_testroot
	rm -f build-stamp 

	-$(MAKE) distclean
	rm -rf bin lib include system.rootrc config/Makefile.config \
	   test/Makefile README/Changelog etc/system.rootrc

	dh_clean

#
# Some notes about this target:
#
# * We use the DESTDIR mechanism to install into the default build
#   directory debian/tmp 
# * If the Changelog file was generated, we install that along with
#   the rest of the documentation. This could be moved to main
#   Makefile 
# * We install INSTALL file along with the rest of the documentation,
#   'cause it contains some useful infromation on third party
#   software.  
# * We remove all the sub-directories CVS from the build directory, so
#   that we may have a clean installation. 
# * Particular in the CINT sub-package there are some problems with
#   file permissions, which we fix. This is things like header files
#   being executable, scripts not executable, and so on
# * A CINT source file has an interpretor line, puting to some
#   directory on Masa's own machine. This is removed.
# * Finally, we move the files into appropiate sub-package
#   directories. The order in which the fiels are moved is very
#   important, since in the base packages, we use wildcards and full
#   directories.

# Some notes about this target:

# * Build architecture-dependent files here.
# * Pass -a to all debhelper commands in this target to reduce
#   clutter. 
# * Please notice that we make the shared library dependency with the
#   --exclude=bin/cint flag. This is because the root-cint package both
#   provides and uses the libCint.so library. Hence, if we let the
#   cint program from generating shared library dependencies we would
#   end up with root-cint depending on it self, which ofcourse is bad.
