root for Debian and Redhat
--------------------------

Abstract:
=========
This document outlines the contents, design, and considerations that
went into making the ROOT packages for Debian and Redhat.  First part
is of general intrest, while the second part is for people who'd like
to know the full story (needed if you wan't to build the packages your
self or do fixes). 

Introduction:
=============
These are the Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat packages of ROOT, the
analysis frame work written in C++. 

The packages are:

* root-cint      Almost bare CINT, the C/C++ interpretor
* libroot        Basic ROOT libraries   
* root-bin       The interactive interface and utilities
* libroot-dev    The header files for the ROOT libraries
* root-daemon    Remote fileserver and PROOF environment
* root-zebra     Conversion tools from HBOOK to ROOT files
* root-star      Contributed classes from STAR Collaboration
* root-ttf       True Type Font support in ROOT
* root-gl	 (Open)GL support for visualisation in ROOT
* root-mysql     MySQL client for ROOT
* root-psql      PostGreSQL client for ROOT
* root-sapdb     SapDB client for ROOT
* root-shift     Interface to SHIFT maanged tape robots
* root-pythia    Wrapper for Pythia event generators
* root-venus     Wrapper for Venus event generator
* task-root	 Meta package for easy installation of ROOT. 

The packages are structured like this, to allow maximum modularity and 
flexibility for the user. 

The latest Debian GNU/Linux packages should be avaliable from
http://cholm.home.cern.ch/cholm, and a back catalog as well as latest
build should be avaliable from the ROOT web-site http://root.cern.ch

It is hoped that these packages will eventually be part of some Debian 
GNU/Linux and Redhat distribtions.  Current licensing issues prohibits 
the packages from entering the "main" distribution of Debian GNU/Linux 
- The ROOT team doesn't allow derived work to be redistributed with
the prior explicit consent of the ROOT team; in any other respect,
ROOT is truly OpenSource. However, these packages will probably go
into "non-free".  Redhat may not have any such policy.  

The current license of ROOT in fact means, that if you built the
Redhat or Debian GNU/Linux packages, you may not redistribute those
without the prior consent of the ROOT team.  The maintainers of the
Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat packages has such a consent and may
therefore redistribute packages.  So, in short, if you got a Redhat or 
Debian GNU/Linux ROOT package set from someone other than the ROOT
team or the maintainers you are in violation with the License!

Original Sources:
=================
The packaging scripts for both Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat - those
normally found in <source dir>/debian or as a seperate spec file - are 
a part of the of the ROOT source tree, hence no patches has been
applied to build the packages.  In fact, the ROOT team maintainer and
the maintainers of the packages has worked closely together on making
ROOT packages for Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat as easy as possible.
This cooperate work has made many improvments to both the packages, as
well as for the ROOT system itself.   

The sources for ROOT are avaliable via anonymous CVS from 

    Repository:   :pserver:cvs@root.cern.ch:/user/cvs 
    Password:     cvs

For more avalibility of ROOT, including other OSs then Linux - IBM
AIX, HP Unix, Digital Unix on Alpha, FreeBSD, Windows, and many others
- please refer to 
  
  http://root.cern.ch 

Parallel Redhat and Debian/GNU Linux Packages:
==============================================
These packages was developed in parallel on both Debian GNU/Linux and 
Redhat, so that a coherent outlook could be maintained over the two
Linux distributions.  

Documentation, Mailing list and Questions:
==========================================
No documentation package is made.  This is because the documentation
is vast and not particulary manageable in a package.  Instead, please 
refer to the ROOT web-site: 

  http://root.cern.ch. 

There you'll find reference pages for every class in ROOT, 

  http://root.cern.ch/root/html/ClassIndex.html

as well as a printable Users guide:

  http://root.cern.ch/root/UsersGuide.html

There's a mailing list for ROOT issues at <roottalk@root.cern.ch>, 
and an archive is avaliable via the main ROOT webpage at

  http://root.cern.ch/root/AboutRootTalk.html

Do not mail directly to the maintainer with questions on ROOT.
Instead mail questions to <roottalk@root.cern.ch> - The maintainer is
on that list and will happily answer questions in that forum.  

Pure CINT and ROOT's CINT:
==========================
To facilitate a parallel installation of a Pure CINT on a Debian
GNU/Linux system, the root-cint package exploits the "alternatives"
feature of dpkg.  Since most ROOT users never use then Pure CINT
programs "cint" and "makecint" is is resonably safe to have a Pure
CINT installation next to ROOT.  A Debian GNU/Linux package of CINT is
being maintained by Richard B. Kreckel. 

I (Christian Holm) know of no such system on Redhat so no attempt to
provide a similar mechanism has been tried.  If anyone should know
about such a system, please let us know. 

Building the Package:
=====================
The basic process of building the RPM and Debian packages is given in
README/INSTALL; here we'll go into the details.   

Basic configuration:
--------------------
The source tree is configured with 

  ./configure <arch> \
		--prefix=<prefix>				\
		--etcdir=<etcdir> 				\
    --enable-star \
		--enable-thread 				\
		--enable-shared 				\
    --enable-soversion \
		--disable-afs 					\
		--disable-srp 					\
		--with-sys-iconpath=/usr/share/pixmaps		\
		--with-ttf-fontdir=/usr/share/fonts/truetype

where <arch> is "linux" for Red Hat and "linuxdeb" for Debian
GNU/Linux.  More will be said on the paths <prefix> and <etcdir>
below.  This configuration has the following meanings: 

* 3rd party libraries:
  The packages will use third-party shared libraries when ever
  possible.  This is noted in the below items. 

* Thread Support and API:
  Since libpthread is generally avaliable in Debian GNU/Linux, this
  feature shouldn't cause any headaches. 

* STAR Contributions:
  This is native to ROOT, and doesn't depend on 3rd-party software,
  hence, there should be no problem. 

* TrueType Font Support:
  Note, that if you want to have system wide TrueType Font support,
  you can install the fonts into the directory

    @prefix@/share/fonts/truetype

  It's possible for individual users to override this path, using the 
  lines 

    # Path where to look for TrueType fonts
    Unix.*.Root.UseTTFonts:     true
    Unix.*.Root.TTFontPath:     <ttffontdir>

  in thier ~/.rootrc, where <ttffontdir> is the path to the TrueType 
  Fonts. 

  The currently supported TrueType Fonts in ROOT are:

      #   Descriptive name            file
    -----------------------------------------------
      1 : times-medium-i-normal       timesi.ttf
      2 : times-bold-r-normal         timesbd.ttf
      3 : times-bold-i-normal         timesi.ttf
      4 : helvetica-medium-r-normal   arial.ttf
      5 : helvetica-medium-o-normal   ariali.ttf
      6 : helvetica-bold-r-normal     arialbd.ttf
      7 : helvetica-bold-o-normal     arialbi.ttf
      8 : courier-medium-r-normal     cour.ttf
      9 : courier-medium-o-normal     couri.ttf
     10 : courier-bold-r-normal       courbd.ttf
     11 : courier-bold-o-normal       courbi.ttf
     12 : symbol-medium-r-normal      symbol.ttf
     13 : times-medium-r-normal       times.ttf
     14 :                             wingding.ttf
  
  These fonts are avaliable from 

     ftp://root.cern.ch/root/ttf/ttf_fonts.tar.gz

  Please note, that these fonts are copyright of Microsoft, under
  restrictive license.  In a nut shell, this license prohibits the
  maintainer from including them in the packages, since it will
  violate other license issues, and make ROOT less close to being
  OpenSource.  For now, we must endure. 

* Version number in soname:
  Debian GNU/Linux (indirectly) mandates that any shared library shall 
  have the major version number the soname, so that the packaging
  system (dpkg/apt) may resolve conflicts, dependencies, etc.  Hence,
  the ROOT libraries are build with the major version number in the 
  soname.  Redhat does not have such a strict policy, but it is
  generally a good idea to set version numbers in sonames (the shared
  library's internal identifier) so that the runtime environment may
  resolve confilcts etc. cleanly. 


Features:
---------
The number of features that is compiled in and how many packages are
made depend upon the system you're building the packages.  The
possible feature packages are 

* root-gl - OpenGL usage:
  You need an OpenGL implementation installed on your system.  Several 
  Debian GNU/Linux and Redhat packages provide OpenGL.  

  If you're running XFree86 version 4 or higher, the OpenGL support
  comes with the X server.  The maintainer highly recommends using
  XFree86 version 4 or above if you want proper 3D rendering.

  If, for some reason, you're stuck with XFree86 version 3.3.x, you
  can get (poor) OpenGL support via the package mesag (Debian) or Mesa
  (Red Hat).  However, some graphics cards - like Matrox G200 and G400
  -  are supported with fully fleshed 3D acceleration, using the
  OpenGL package libutahglx1, so it's recommended to checkout this
  package first. 

* root-zebra - ZEBRA conversion tools:
  The CERNLIB libraries libpacklib and libkernlib are statically
  linked into the applications h2root and g2root, so these need only
  be installed at build time.  As of the 2000 release, CERNLIB is
  released under GNU GPL (see @prefix@/share/doc/copyright/GPL), so
  this package must be distributed under the GNU GPL. 

* root-mysql - MySQL client API:
  All you need is the MySQL client library, which for Debian GNU/Linux
  is avaliable in the main distribution in section libs.  The client
  library is also avaliable for Redhat, either on the PowerTools CD,
  or from the MySQL web-site <http://www.mysql.com>. 

* root-psql - PostGreSQL client API:
  All you need is the PostGreeSQL client library, which is avaliable
  in both Debian and Red Hat.

* root-sapdb - Sap DB support: 
  ROOT interface to the Sap DB Relational Database Manager.
  Currently there exists only SapDB packages for Red Hat and non for
  Debian.  This feature has not been tested extensively. 

* root-shift - SHIFT interface:
  The SHIFT API library libshift is statically linked into libRFIO, so  
  you only need this library when building the package.  No Copyright
  notice was found anywhere for SHIFT, so use this feature with some
  discresion.  In no way will the maintainer claim any responsebility
  for misuse of this feature on the recipient of this packages
  part.  You have been warned. 

* root-pythia - Pythia interfaces:
  The ROOT interfaces to event generators Pythia version 5 and 6 uses
  dynamic loading, so you need to have libPythia.so and libPythia6.so
  installed on your system.  The maintainer of these packages also
  provide a Pythia Debian GNU/Linux packages as well as one for
  Redhat.  You can get them from  

    http://cholm.home.cern.ch/cholm

  Alternatively, you can get the libraries from the ROOT web-site and
  install it anywhere you want, or you may opt to build it yourself.
  Please refer to the ROOT install file for more information. 

  Pythia is copyright of Thorbjorn Sjostrand.  Again note that no
  lisence information was found anywhere, so use this feature with
  some discresion.  In no way will the maintainer claim any
  responsebility for misuse of this feature on the recipient of this
  packages part.  You have been warned.  

* root-venus - Venus Event Generator interface:
  This package has not been tested at all. 

Other features exist in the ROOT distribution, namely AFS and SRP
support, but was not used in this package.  AFS and SRP support
affects crucial binaries (rootd and proofd) in the ROOT system, and
since one can not clearly seperate out these binaries from the system,
it was choosen not to include AFS and SRP support, since one may be in
a situation where on root-daemon package has AFS and SRP support, and
another not.  In the future, there might be an extra package with AFS
and SRP support. 

Some Red Hat notes:
-------------------
The avaliability of third-party libraries on the system that made the
root.spec file dictates which packages will be build.  Hence, if you
got a spec file from somewhere else, it may not be right for your
system.  The packages build from any given spec file can be examined
by look at the end of the spec, at the line contaning the command 

   build/package/lib/makerpmfiles.sh 

The list after the 5'th argument is the packages that this spec file
builds (possibly empty). 

If you feel you may have more or less features avaliable on your
system, try run configure as  

   ./configure linux --pkglist 

This will give you a list of the packages that is possible to build on
your system.  If that list differs from the one in the spec file, you
should remake the spec file with 

   make redhat 

Some Debian notes:
------------------
The avaliability of third-party libraries on the system that made the
debian directory dictates which packages will be build.  Hence, if you
got source package from somewhere else, it may not be right for your
system.  Inspect the file debian/control to see the packages build.  

If you feel you may have more or less features avaliable on your
system, try run configure as  

   ./configure linux --pkglist 

This will give you a list of the packages that is possible to build on
your system.  If that list differs from those in the debian/control
file, you should remake the debian directory with 

   ./build/package/lib/makedebdir.sh 

Rebuilding the packages:
========================
If you are reading this in the ROOT source directory, with the intent
of building this package yourself, these a few issues you need to
observe:

* The license of ROOT doesn't allow you to redistribute a package
  without the explicit consent of the ROOT team, since such a package
  consitute "derived work". 
* The packages created with the files in this directory was structured
  to make the packages as modular as possible.  However, if you
  disagree with the structure, please contact the maintainer, stating
  your reasons, and you're prefered structure.
* Please check the ROOT web-site or http://cholm.home.cern.ch first to
  see if a set of packages already exist for the current ROOT
  version. 
* Do not move files yourself. 

Make sure you've got the nessecary libraries/headers/fonts installed. 
Should you want to not include a feature and the corresponding
package in the build, you should edit the file in

  build/package/lib/makedebdir.sh   or
  build/package/lib/makerpmspec.sh

The definition of variable "pkgs" is usual defined via 

    ./configure [linuxdeb|linux] --pkglist 

Starting from that output, you can set that variable yourself.  For 
example, to build only the basic (read: minimal) set of packages
libroot, libroot-dev, root-bin, root-daemon and root-cint, the
definition should read:  

	pkgs="task-root root-daemon root-cint root-bin libroot-dev libroot"  

Please note that the order is important (See note one ".files" files
below). 

Per default, the packages are build with prefix=/usr and
etcdir=/etc/root.  Depending on the system, you can more or less
easily redefine this to something else, say prefix=/usr/local.  

* Debian: Edit the file 

    build/package/lib/makedebdir.sh 

  so that prefix and/or etcdir is set to where you want to install the 
  package.  

* Red Hat:  First make the spec file.  Then at the top of the spec file
  edit the definition of _prefix and _sysconfdir to your liking.

To make the package, cd to the toplevel source diretory, and do a
"make debian" or "make redhat" - that's it.  All packaging files are
made and no patches are applied.  Please also refer to
README/INSTALL. 


Package Bugs, etc.:
===================
Debian GNU/Linux wants the <library>.so symlinks in the dev packages,
but unfortunally that is not possible.  The ROOT libraries loads some 
libraries dynamically, and at the moment, the library file must end in
one of .so, .a, .sl, or .dll, so the <library>.so files _must_ be in
the binary packages.  If the ROOT team would change that behaviour of
TSystem::Load(), then we could seperate out the development symlinks.  

Since this package is not in any Debian GNU/Linux distribution, the
regular Debian GNU/Linux bug tracking system cannot be used. 
Therefore, please send bug reports to the Debian GNU/Linux package
maintainer <cholm@nbi.dk>.     

The same goes for the Redhat package, but send bugs reports to 
<waananen@nbi.dk> 

Notes on the packaging scripts:
===============================
As far as possible, the packaging scripts for both Redhat and Debian
GNU/Linux is build from the same source.  For example, package
descriptions and file lists are kept in a generic form and only made
concrete during package build.  Doing it like that, we can easily
maintain both sets of packages at the same time and still be
coherent. 

In the directory "build", you will find the subdirectory "package". 
Looking into that you'll see three subdirectories: 

  common
  debian 
  lib
  rpm 

The "common" subdirectory contains the files that are common to both
sets as well as generic "source" files for other files.  You'll find
this file there too.  

The "lib" directory contains a number of scripts to build the final
packaging scripts from the common source files. 

The "debian" subdirectory contains files that are "final" (i.e., will
not be changed during package set build), as well as skeleton files.
Skeleton files end in ".in" and will be modified during package set
build.  

The "rpm" directory only contains skeleton spec files, one for each
package and two global ones. These files will be merge into one file,
after appropiate substitutions are made, into the final spec file 

Common subdirectory:
--------------------
The common source files in the common directory are organised by
giving the descriptive names: 

  <cmn file name> ::= <pkg>.<type>

where <pkg> is the last part in the packages names e.g., "<pkg>=bin"
corresponds to package "root-bin", and <type> describes what kind of
"source" file this is. Currently we have  

            <pkg> ::= root-cint  
		      libroot   
		      root-bin   
		      libroot-dev   
		      root-daemon
		      root-zebra 
		      root-star  
		      root-ttf   
		      root-opengl
		      root-mysql 
		      root-shift 
		      root-pythia

           <type> ::= conffiles
		      copyright
		      dscr
		      files
		      postinst
		      postrm
		      preinst
		      prerm
		      
* conffiles:
  list of configuration files for sub-package if any. In the RPM spec
  file they should be marked by "%config". For the deb package they
  should be put in a file "<pkg>.conffiles". 

* copyright: 
  This only applies to the deb packages. If file <pkg>.copyright
  exist, and the file ../debian/<pkg>.copyright.in exist, the former
  will be insert into the later at the mark "@copyright" and stored in 
  <pkg>.copyright in the package directory.  Also, if there is a
  file ../debian/copyright.in, the LICENSE file in the top directory
  will be insert to the former and stored in copyright in the
  packaging directory, thus giving a common copyright file for all
  packages that doesn't have it's own file. 

* dscr: 
  The contents of these files will insert into ../debian/control.in
  and ../rpm/spec.in at marks @short@ and @long@, and the
  output will be stored in ../../../debian/control or in the final
  spec file ../rpm/root.spec. The format of these files are 

      short: <short descrition - less then 60 characters>
      long:
      <free format long description. Break into paragraphs by blank
      lines. Indented lines are not formated. Use plain english.>

  The text after "short:" will be replaced for @short@ and the
  text after "long:" will be insert for @long@. Please note,
  that there should be no empty lines after the last line of text in
  the long descritption. Other wise, one is fairly free to format the
  text as one wants, though one should aim to stay within the 70th
  column (looks best on an plain text console). 

* files: 
  List of files that go into package <pkg>. They should be listed one
  per line. Wildcards are allowed. 

  Note that RPM behaves somewhat curiously when making many
  packages. It will happily install the same file into many
  sub-packages, if that file is specified in the file list for more
  then one package.  A file can be specified to be in more then one
  package directly or indirectly - via wildcard or  because it's in an
  included directory.  This is not what we want. 

  Therefore, when we make the rpm packages we only make the file list
  files _after_ the temporary installation into rpm/tmp.  What we do
  then, for each package in turn - the order is important - move the
  files needed into a tar file, using the .shlibs, .conffiles, and
  .files to specify what files to include.  Then we list the contents
  of these archives, and use that for the file list for each package.
  This does create some overhead due to packing and unpacking, but on
  most machines this will be no more then a couple of minutes.
  Incidently, this is almost how the debhelper tools work. 

* shlibs:
  List of shared libraries, if any, that go into package <pkg>. It's
  important to specify the libraries correctly here, since this is
  what RPM and dpkg uses for binary dependencies. 
 
* preinst:
  Body of a pre-installation script.  No magic line - #!/bin/sh - can
  be specified.  The contents of this file is put into the spec file
  in case of rpm packages, or in <pkg>.preinst in case of deb
  packages. Please note that the daemon package needs some special
  treatment, since Redhat and Debian GNU/Linux adds users and groups
  in slightly differently - we need to add the (system) user rootd,
  remember. 

* postinst:
  Body of a post-installation script.  No magic line - #!/bin/sh - can 
  be specified.  The contents of this file is put into the spec file
  in case of rpm packages, or in <pkg>.postinst in case of deb
  packages. Please note that the daemon package needs some special
  treatment, since Redhat and Debian GNU/Linux adds users and groups
  in slightly differently - we need to add the (system) user rootd,
  remember. 

* prerm:
  Body of a pre-removal script.  No magic line - #!/bin/sh - can
  be specified.  The contents of this file is put into the spec file
  in case of rpm packages, or in <pkg>.prerm in case of deb
  packages. Please note that the daemon package needs some special
  treatment, since Redhat and Debian GNU/Linux adds users and groups
  in slightly differently - we need to add the (system) user rootd,
  remember. 

* postrm:
  Body of a post-removal script.  No magic line - #!/bin/sh - can
  be specified.  The contents of this file is put into the spec file
  in case of rpm packages, or in <pkg>.postrm in case of deb
  packages. Please note that the daemon package needs some special
  treatment, since Redhat and Debian GNU/Linux adds users and groups
  in slightly differently - we need to add the (system) user rootd,
  remember. 

Script library subdirectory:
----------------------------

To make maintaince easier, the task of creating the Redhat Linux and
Debian GNU/Linux packaging files is split into many sub-task, each
with  dedicated script. In general, the scripts accept one argument,
the package name

Note that the packaging scripts uses short names for the packages, as
outlined above.  Also, all scripts are executed from the top of the
ROOT source directory. 

There are three categories of scripts in the library directory.
Common, package, and distribution scripts. 

  Common Scripts:
  ---------------
  * common.sh 
    This script is _sourced_ by almost all other scripts.  It takes
    one argument, the package architecture - i.e., rpm or debian.  
    This script defines various variables that is used extensively in
    the rest of the scripts, like the ROOT version, source, packaging,
    and other directories.  However, most importantly, it defines the
    list of pacakges to create in variable "pkgs".  The order in which
    the packages appear in this list is important.  (see .files
    description above.)  Also, if one doesn't want to build a
    particular package, if a third party library ins't present on the
    system for example,  that package can simply taken out of the
    list, and it will not be build. 

  * makeconfigure.sh
    This scripts outputs the "./configure" commandline based on the
    package list in common.sh.  The output is stored in the rpm spec
    file rpm/root.spec for Redhat Linux, or in the debian/rules file
    in case of Debian GNU/Linux.  Again, this script must be told the
    packaging system.  

  Distribution scripts:
  ---------------------
  * makerpmspec.sh 
    This scripts makes the rpm/root.spec file.  It loops over the
    packages defined in common.sh and executes makerpmspecs.sh for
    each package. This script takes no arguments. 

  * makerpmfiles.sh 
    This script makes the package file lists for each package defined
    in common.sh, as outline in the .files description above.  It is
    executed from the rpm spec file in the install section after all
    binaries have been installed into the temporary directory rpm/tmp.
    It doesn't take any arguments.   

  * makerpmclean.sh 
    Cleans up after a rpm package build. 

  * makedebdir.sh 
    This script makes the debian directory, moves static files into
    it, and loops over each package defined in common.sh to build the
    various files needed. 

  * makedebchangelog.sh 
    Write (and if nessecary updates) the debian/changelog file. This
    is important, since dpkg-buildpackage uses this file for
    identifying the package, it's version and urgency. 

  * makedebclean.sh 
    Cleans up after a deb package build. 

  Package scripts:
  ----------------
  These scripts are devided into rpm and deb specific ones.  They must
  be passed the package name.  

  * makerpmspecs.sh 
    This script parses the common source files .<post|pre><inst|rm>, 
    .dscr and writes an appropiate sub-package spec file. 

  * makedebconffiles.sh 
    This scrips parses <pkg>.conffiles, and writes
    debian/<pkg>.conffiles. 

  * makedebcontrol.sh 
    This script parses <pkg>.dscr and writes the short and long
    description to debian/control in the appropiate section. 

  * makedebcopyright.sh 
    Parses <pkg>.copyright (if it exists) and writes it to
    debian/<pkg>.copyright.  Also, if no package is passed to the
    file, it'll write the general debain/copyright file, based on the 
    LICENSE file in the top most directory. 

  * makedebdocs.sh 
    Parses <pkg>.docs (if it exists) and writes an appropiate
    debian/<pkg>.docs. 

  * makedebexamples.sh 
    Parses <pkg>.examples (if it exists) and writes an appropiate
    debian/<pkg>.examples. 
   
  * makedebfiles.sh 
    Parses the <pkg>.shlibs, <pkg>.conffiles, and <pkg>.files files
    (those that exist) and writes debian/<pkg>.files.  This is
    needed, 'cause debhelper wants all entries (directories, files,
    including wildcards) on one line. 

  * makedebrules.sh 
    Adds the passed package to the list of packages in debian/rules to
    be build. The order in which the packages are passed to this
    script is important (see .files description above). 

  * makedebscr.sh 
    Parses any of <pkg>.<pre|post><inst|rm> and writes corresponding
    script to debain/<pkg>.<pre|post><inst|rm>. 

  * makedebshlocal.sh
    Parses <pkg>.shlibs for each package defined and writes entry(ies)
    to debian/shlibs.local, so that dpkg may figure out the
    dependencies.
