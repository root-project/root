XZDEC(1)                           XZ Utils                           XZDEC(1)



NAME
       xzdec, lzmadec - Small .xz and .lzma decompressors

SYNOPSIS
       xzdec [option...]  [file...]
       lzmadec [option...]  [file...]

DESCRIPTION
       xzdec is a liblzma-based decompression-only tool for .xz (and only .xz)
       files.  xzdec is intended to work as a drop-in replacement for xz(1) in
       the  most  common  situations where a script has been written to use xz
       --decompress --stdout (and possibly a few other commonly used  options)
       to  decompress  .xz  files.   lzmadec is identical to xzdec except that
       lzmadec supports .lzma files instead of .xz files.

       To reduce the size of the  executable,  xzdec  doesn't  support  multi-
       threading  or  localization,  and doesn't read options from XZ_DEFAULTS
       and XZ_OPT environment variables.   xzdec  doesn't  support  displaying
       intermediate  progress information: sending SIGINFO to xzdec does noth-
       ing, but sending SIGUSR1 terminates the process instead  of  displaying
       progress information.

OPTIONS
       -d, --decompress, --uncompress
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec supports only decompres-
              sion.

       -k, --keep
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec never creates or removes
              any files.

       -c, --stdout, --to-stdout
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec always writes the decom-
              pressed data to standard output.

       -q, --quiet
              Specifying this once does nothing since xzdec never displays any
              warnings or notices.  Specify this twice to suppress errors.

       -Q, --no-warn
              Ignored for xz(1) compatibility.  xzdec never uses the exit sta-
              tus 2.

       -h, --help
              Display a help message and exit successfully.

       -V, --version
              Display the version number of xzdec and liblzma.

EXIT STATUS
       0      All was good.

       1      An error occurred.

       xzdec doesn't have any warning messages like xz(1) has, thus  the  exit
       status 2 is not used by xzdec.

NOTES
       Use  xz(1)  instead of xzdec or lzmadec for normal everyday use.  xzdec
       or lzmadec are meant only for situations where it is important to  have
       a smaller decompressor than the full-featured xz(1).

       xzdec  and  lzmadec are not really that small.  The size can be reduced
       further by dropping features from liblzma at  compile  time,  but  that
       shouldn't  usually  be done for executables distributed in typical non-
       embedded operating system distributions.  If you need a truly small .xz
       decompressor, consider using XZ Embedded.
