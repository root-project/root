* Notice *******************************************************************

 - From Mar/2004, I start working on re-engineering of bytecode compiler
   which has been a major source of bugs.  Hence this is a major change
   of the system, I'll have to slowdown user support and bug fix. I'd 
   appreciate your understanding. High priority problems will still get 
   fixed.


* New features *************************************************************

 - Major re-engineering on bytecode compiler
   Cint5.15.x   : legacy Cint, 
   Cint6.0.x    : preliminarily reengineering version, 
   

 - Visual C++ .NET support
   Visual C++ .NET is supported from cint5.15.120. Go to platform/VisualCpp7
   directory and run setup script. After that, you need to run setup script
   in lib/longlong, lib/win32api, lib/posix and lib/dll_stl directories.
   You can use full functionality of Cint.  There is a problem Windows batch
   command that child processes do not run properly. That is why you need to
   run setup.bat script in each lib/* directory.

 - Qt library
   Qt-Cint is experimentally supported from 5.15.108. Refer to 
   lib/qt/README.txt and demo/qt/README.txt. Currently, Qt-Cint is supported
   only on Windows with VC++6.0 compiler.  Qt-Cint implementation is quite
   premature.  Your feedback will be greatly appreciated.

 - DLL loading without makecint/rootcint for Intel CPU
   From 5.15.102, you can load global functions in DLL without 
   makecint/rootcint if you use Intel 32bit CPU with gcc3.2, VC++ or BC++. 
   You need to specify DLL filename and function interface by 
      extern "[dllname]" { ... }
   Refer to doc/ref.txt for detail.

 - Cygwin5.1 support
   From 5.15.101, Cygwin5.1 is supported with full Cint functionality including
   dynamic loading. Read platform/README.txt and try platform/cygwin51_gcc3_so.

 -  VC++7.1 support
   Try platform/visualCpp7/setup[XXX].bat for setup. This version uses new
   templated iostream library.

 -  Command prompt input mode
   A new command prompt input mode is added from version 5.15.74. The new mode
   can be activated by setting 'INPUTMODE = C++' in $CINTSYSDIR/MAKEINFO.
   See doc/ref.txt - INPUTMODE for more detail.

 -  Test suite
   Cint test suite goes with source code package. The test suite is a 
   collection of test programs reported with bug reports. Read test/README.txt
   for more detail.

 -  Borland C++ compiler 5.5 support
   Free version of Borland BCC32.exe comiler is available from 
   http://www.borland.com.  BCC32.exe version 5.5 is supported from
   cint5.15.53.  Refer to c:\cint\platform\borlandcc5\README.txt.

 -  New iostream redirection scheme is implemented in lib/*stream/iostrm.h.
   The code is implementation dependent which needs to be tested on each
   compiler and computer platform. If you fail to compile src/*strm.cxx,
   please look into corresponding lib/*stream/iostrm.h, fix the problem and
   send me appropriate fix. 

 -  DLL binary compatibility is discountinued between 5.14.X to 5.15.X. Please
   re-compile all the CINT DLLs. After 5.15.02, DLL binary compatibility became
   more robust.

 - gcc-3.00 support
    gcc-3.00 is supported from 5.15.14. Use platform/linux_RH6.2_gcc3 to
   compile Cint with gcc-3.00 on RedHat6.2 Linux. This configuration has many
   problems still. The author is working to solve them.

 - Power operator '**' delete option
    Cint have had power operator '**' as an original extension. However, this
   causes problem if we look C/C++ syntax strictly. 'a**b' is 'a power b' for
   Cint and 'a*(*b)' for compiled code. G__NOPOWEROPR compile flag is added
   to turn off '**' operator. Add -DG__NOPOWEROPR to OTHMACRO in platform
   dependency file. From 5.15.25, power operator is deleted by default.

 - WildC++ with Tcl/Tk8.3
    WildC++ interpreter, a mixture of Cint and Tcl/Tk, used to require older
   Tcl/Tk. Now, it supports newer Tcl/Tk8.3. Please find it in lib/wintcldl83.

 - New API
   Following API functions are added. Please refer to doc/ref.txt.

   char* G__load_text(char* namedmacro); 
         loading on memory C++ source code.

   void G__set_emergencycallback(void (*p2f)())
         set behavior of '.save' command for emergency object save


 - Exception handling example
   Exception handling has been implemented long time ago. However, it has
  not been informed enough to the users.  A new example is added in 
  demo/exception directory. Refer to demo/exception/README.txt for the
  details.


 - Experimental multi-threading libcintX.so
   Multi-threading libcintX.so capability is provided experimentally. This
  is a very clude implementation and NOT RECOMMENDEDN FOR ORDINARY USERS.
   For Linux RedHat6.2, platform dependency file platform/linux_RH6.2_mtso 
  is prepared. Install Cint with 'sh ./setup platform/linux_RH6.2_mtso' and
  try example in demo/multilibcint directory.
   For Windows VC++6.0, add G__MULTITHREADLIBCINT macro at the beginning of
  G__ci.h. This has to be done before Cint compilation. Install Cint and
  try example in demo/multilibcint directory.


 - Xlib and openGL support
   X11R6 and openGL APIs are supported from 5.14.86. include/X11/xlib.dll and
  include/GL/gl.dll can be built under lib/xlib and lib/gl directory. Simple
  example for X11 program can be found in demo/xlib directory. OpenGL example
  is missing right now. Your contribution to add an openGL programming example
  will be greatly appreciated.  Those libraries are verified only on Linux
  RedHat6.2 at this moment.


 - Error message callback
   Error message can be redirected through an user defined callback function.
  The callback can be set by G__set_errmsgcallback(void (*p2f)(char*)) API.
  This feature is convenient when a user wants to embed cint into a GUI based
  host program. See doc/ref.txt for G__set_errmsgcallback.
   A special care is needed to compile src/disp.c. Some compiler may report
  an error in variable argument declaration around line 1972-1978. If you 
  find a compile error, please modify the source appropriately. Your report
  about such change , regarding specific platform , is highly appreciated.
   This feature is normally turned off. You need to define 
  'OTHMACRO = -DG__ERRORCALLBACK' in platform dependency file for activation.
  An example is added in demo/errpipe directory.


 - Variable argument
   Variable argument is supported from Cint 5.14.69 for Intel architecture. 
  <stdarg.h> must be included to use variable argument. Cint accepts both 
  form of declaration.
       void foo1(char *fmt, ...);
       void foo2(char *fmt ...);
   Argument values for Variable arguments are put into function call stack.
  For each computer platform, specific byte layout must be emulated by Cint.
  Because byte layout is not publicly informed, this capability may not be 
  portable to all platforms. At this moment, only Linux and Win32 with Intel
  architecture are verified. It is known that this scheme can not be extended
  to HP-PA and Sparc architecture. Need more investigation for other platforms.


 - "ifdef" utility is added to the package. Read doc/ifdef.txt for the detail.
        "ifdef" selectively resolves #ifdef,#ifndef,#if,#elif,
       #else and #endif in C/C++ source code. Macros that are 
       explicitly defined/undefined by -D/-U option are resolved
       and eliminated from the source code. Other #ifdefs remain
       unchanged. #if statements with multiple conditions and
       &&,|| operators will be resolved by a symbolic resolver.
       "ifdef" can be also used as a #ifdef nesting hierarchy
       analyzer.
         Although included in CINT package, ifdef is an independent
        software productivity tool.


 - New memory allocation method is fully activated in cint5.14.64. This
   scheme is tested under most of the platforms. 
    + If you find compiling src/Apiif.cxx or other dictionary code due to
      'void operator delete(void*,[DLLID]_tag*)', undefine G__EH_DUMMY_DELETE
      macro in G__ci.h around line 195.
    + Uncomment '#define G__OLDIMPLEMENTATION1423' in G__ci.h to disable the 
      new scheme.
    + Alternatively, you can give '-cint -M0x0', '-cint -M0x10' or 
      '-cint -M0x1c' option to makecint in order to use the old memory 
      allocation scheme.
    + A version of IBM AIX-xlC compiler has a problem compiling explicit 
      destructor calls for implicitly created destructor. This is supposed 
      to be a compiler bug.
    + MicroSoft Visual C++97 (or VC++5.0) can not compile dictionary with
      new memory allocation system. With VC++5.0 or older version, cint will
      use the old method. (Do not include vcstrmold.cxx and Apiifold.cxx to
      ROOT source tree.)


 - -Y[0|1] option, controls if std namespace is ignored or not. -Y1 (ignore
   std namespace) is a default. If you specify -Y0 option, you must explicitly
   use std:: namespace. For example,

     $ cint -Y0 string
     cint> { std::string a="abcdefg"; }

   Note that CINT header file is reorganized for this purpose. In order to
   use this feature, you must use new header files. (Under $CINTSYSDIR/include
   and $CINTSYSDIR/stl directories.)


 - -Z[0|1] option, loading std header files implicitly with DLL
   With -Z1, std header files included in making cint dictionary are
   implicitly loaded with DLL. Consider following example,

      // myapp.h
      #include <string>
      void f(const string& x) { ... }

   When you make cint dictionary, std header file <string> is implicitly 
   loaded with myapp.dll if -Z1 option is given both to makecint and cint.

      $  makecint -mk makefile -dl myapp.dll -H myapp.h -cint -Z1
      $  make -f makefile
      $  cint -Z1 myapp.dll

   -Z1 is a default for pure CINT and -Z0 is a default for ROOT.


 - True virtual function resolution in mixed interpreted/precompiled-class
   environment is supported by STUB.  Base class and interface of derived 
   class have to be precompiled and derived class member function can be 
   interpreted. Please find example in demo/makecint/Stub2 directory.


 - Protected member access for compiled class
   '#pragma link C++ class+protected [classname];' is added to allow
   protected member access of compiled base class from interpreted derived
   class.


 - !!! Special notes about past changes !!!

   Following changes were deactivated because of bad side-effects. 

    1289 : Tried to support true pointer to static member function. But
	   because side effect was found, this feature is turned off.
