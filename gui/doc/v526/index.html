<h3>GUI</h3>

<h4>TRootCanvas/TCanvas</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement tooltip displaying information about the primitive below the mouse pointer in a canvas.
<br/>It is possible to enable/disable this optional feature with the "Tooltip Info" menu entry from the "View" menu of the canvas. 
<br/>To change the default behaviour (off by default), a new option has been added in system.rootrc:
<br/><tt>Canvas.ShowToolTips:        false</tt></li>
</ul>

<h4>TBrowser</h4>
<ul>
<li>Automatically switch to the tab containing the current canvas (if any) when e.g. drawing a histogram by double-clicking on its list tree item in a root file.</li>
<li>Automatically switch to (and update) the list of files in the file browser (left panel) when opening a ROOT file from the "Open File" menu</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGListView</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard navigation is now fully working in the list view.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGMainFrame</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allow to save a snapshot of the GUI in a picture file. The supported formats are gif, jpg, png, tiff, and xpm.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGFileDialog</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allow to change directory by typing its name in the text entry field of the dialog</li>
</ul>

<h4>TProofProgressDialog</h4>
<ul>
<li>Added a speedometer widget (TGSpeedo) to display the processing rate</li>
<li>Added a check button to enable/disable smooth update of the speedometer (enabled by default). This could be useful in the case of slow displays (e.g. when using it via ssh)</li>
<li>Several layout improvements</li>
</ul>

<h4>TRecorder</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improvements and consolidation of the cross-platform interoperability, allowing to record and replay sessions between different platforms with less side effects. NB: Using different OS/WM (Window Managers) and using different ROOT GUI settings (via e.g. system.rootrc) between recording and replaying may still produce a wrong behavior of the recorder.</li>
<li>New tutorial guitest_playback.C replaying a recorded session showing and validating the GUI (using guitest.C)</li>
</ul>
