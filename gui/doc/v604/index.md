- New class, the TGTextViewostream is a text viewer widget. It is a specialization of TGTextView and std::ostream, and it uses a TGTextViewStreamBuf, who inherits from std::streambuf, allowing to stream text directly to the text view in a cout-like fashion. A new tutorial showing how to use the TGTextViewostream widget has also been added
