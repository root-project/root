<h4>TRootBrowser</h4>
<ul>
<li>Following a <a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?84696">user request</a> on savannah, 
a filtering mechanism in the browser has been implemented. To filter the content of a file 
(or a folder inside a file), simply click on the "Filter" button. A dialog will popup, asking 
for a filtering expression string (regexp like). The filter will then be applied on the current 
list tree item (folder) and will stay active until a wildcard ("*") expression or an empty 
string ("") is entered as new filtering value. The filter button automatically reflects the 
status of any selected list tree item, and if a filter is active on it, the button state is 
"engaged" and its tooltip shows what is actually displayed in this file/folder. It is possible 
to filter several files/folders, each one having its own filtering argument.

</ul>

<h4>TGNumberEntry</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a possible overflow when entering a float having its fraction part exceeding kMaxInt (e.g 9.9999999999). This fix the <a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/index.php?84033">bug #84033</a>, TGNumberEntryField
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TTreeViewer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Make the "Histogram" text entry expanding in X direction (i.e. resize it when resizing the tree viewer)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGInputDialog</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a hack to detect if user press cancel or if an empty string ("") has been selected. 
When the Cancel button is pressed, the first two characters are reset to 0, and if the user select 
an empty string ("") the first character is reset to 0 and the second one is set to 1.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGPrintDialog</h4>
<ul>
<li>The "Printer" text entry has been replaced by a combo box populated with the list of available printers on the system, and select the default one, if any.
</li>
</ul>
