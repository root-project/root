<h3>GUI</h3>

<h4>TGFileDialog</h4>
<ul>
<li> Properly change directory when navigating in the directory tree.</li>
<li> Make the File Dialog resizable.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGFSContainer</h4>
<ul>
<li> Create specific icons for symlinks (add a small arrow on the bottom left corner of the original icon).</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGListBox</h4>
<ul>
<li> Enabled <tt>CurrentChanged(TGFrame*)</tt> and <tt>CurrentChanged(Int_t,Int_t)</tt> signals, allowing to handle keyboard navigation/selection.
<br/> For example:
<pre>   TGLBContainer *lbc = (TGLBContainer *)fListBox->GetContainer();
   lbc->Connect("CurrentChanged(TGFrame*)", "MyGuiClass", this, "CurrentChanged(TGFrame*)");

   void MyGuiClass::CurrentChanged(TGFrame *f)
   {
      TGTextLBEntry *lbe = (TGTextLBEntry *)f;
      printf("\nMyGuiClass::CurrentChanged() : Id = %d, Text = %s\n", lbe->EntryId(), lbe->GetTitle());
   }
</pre></li>
</ul>

<h4>TGSlider</h4>
<ul>
<li> Added <tt>SetEnabled(Bool_t)</tt> and <tt>SetState(Bool_t)</tt>, allowing to disable or enable the TGSlider widgets (will be greyed if disabled).</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGToolTip</h4>
<ul>
<li> Use a better way of positionning tooltips when they go out of screen</li>
<li> Avoid to overlap the mouse pointer when repositioning it (flickering effect!)</li>
</ul>

<h4>TRootBrowser</h4>
<ul>
<li> Implemented the alphabetical sorting mechanism in the file browser.
The sorting is applied only in the current directory and the browser remembers every sorted directory.
For this purpose, a new picture button has been added to the file browser plug-in (the status of this button reflects the sorting status of each directory)
<br/>Another button has been added to the file browser plug-in, used for refreshing the current directory in the list tree.
Refreshing now checks also if files still exist in the current directory
(for the case where files have been deleted by the user or by another application)</li>
<li> Allow to change graphic properties of an object (e.g. a histogram) in a Root file via the context menu from the browser (by opening a ged editor)</li>
<li> Size of directories, trees, and objects associated to keys inside Root files, or any kind of browsable object can be displayed in their associated tooltip, as soon as their GetObjectInfo() method returns their size as a long long int formatted in a const char * ("%lld")</li>
</ul>

<h4>TRootContextMenu</h4>
<ul>
<li> Close the context menu if the selected object is being deleted in the RecursiveRemove() operation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TRootCanvas/TRootEmbeddedCanvas</h4>
<ul>
<li> Drag and drop improvements for images (don't add margins between the canvas/pad border and the picture itself).</li>
</ul>
