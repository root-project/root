  <li>Xrootd
    <ul>
      <li>New version 20100913-0630
including several consolidation fixes (many due to Coverity reports)
and includes the new Bonjour/Avahi interface used for worker
autodiscovery in PROOF.</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>TMessage and TSocket
  <ul>
     <li>
<tt>TMessage</tt> now relies on the new interface <tt>TBuffer::TagStreamerInfo</tt> instead of <tt>TBuffer::IncrementLevel</tt> which had the disadvantage of being called not only
during writing but also during reading (where there is no need to keep track of the <tt>TStreamerInfo</tt> used).<br/>This change allows to keep the calls to IncrementLevel/DecrementLevel only in the case the buffer is a <tt>TBufferXML</tt>.</li>
    <li>
The implementation of <tt>TSocket::RecvStreamerInfos</tt> has been fixed to properly handle the case where there are abstract classes (in this case <tt>GetStreamerInfo()</tt> can not be called on the abstract class until it has
been called during the processing of one of the concrete derived classes) and the case of <tt>STL</tt> containers.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
