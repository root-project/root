# Syntax: StartCMS [-c cfile] [-D] [-t] [-v] [oth]

# Where:  -c  specifies the configuration file to be used.
#         -D  turns on internal debugging.
#         -t  types the commands and does not execute them
#         -v  produces verbose output.
#         oth Any other options to be passed to the executable.

#
# Set default values from the StartXRD.cf file
#
. `dirname $0`/StartXRD.cf

VERBOSE=0

# Set TEST to equal /bin/echo to only display lines to be executed
