<title>Graphics and the Graphical User Interface</title>

<para>Graphical capabilities of ROOT range from 2D objects (lines, polygons,
arrows) to various plots, histograms, and 3D graphical objects. In this chapter,
we are going to focus on principals of graphics and 2D objects. Plots and
histograms are discussed in a chapter of their own.</para>

<sect1>
<title>Drawing Objects</title>
<para>In ROOT, most objects derive from a base class
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>. This class has a virtual
method <code>Draw()</code> so all objects are supposed to be able to be "drawn".
The basic whiteboard on which an object is drawn is called a canvas (defined by
the class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis>). If several
canvases are defined, there is only one active at a time. One draws an object in
the active canvas by using the statement:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">object.Draw()
</programlisting>

<para>This instructs the object "<code>object</code>" to draw itself. If no
canvas is opened, a default one (named "<code>c1</code>") is instantiated and is
drawn.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">TLine a(0.1,0.1,0.6,0.6)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">a.Draw()</emphasis>
&lt;TCanvas::MakeDefCanvas&gt;: created default TCanvas with name c1
</programlisting>

<para>The first statement defines a line and the second one draws it. A default
canvas is drawn since there was no opened one.</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Interacting with Graphical Objects</title>
<para>When an object is drawn, one can interact with it. For example, the line
drawn in the previous paragraph may be moved or transformed. One very important
characteristic of ROOT is that transforming an object on the screen will also
transform it in memory. One actually interacts with the real object, not with a
copy of it on the screen. You can try for instance to look at the starting X
coordinate of the line:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] a.GetX1()
(double)1.000000000e-1
</programlisting>

<para><code>X1</code> is the <code>x</code> value of the starting coordinate
given in the definition above. Now move it interactively by clicking with the
left mouse button in the line's middle and try to do again:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] a.GetX1()
(Double_t)1.31175468483816005e-01
</programlisting>

<para>You do not obtain the same result as before, the coordinates of
'<code>a</code>' have changed. As said, interacting with an object on the screen
changes the object in memory.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Moving, Resizing and Modifying Objects</title>
<para>Changing the graphic objects attributes can be done with the GUI or
programmatically. First, let's see how it is done in the GUI.</para>

<sect3>
<title>The Left Mouse Button</title>
<para>As was just seen moving or resizing an object is done with the left mouse
button. The cursor changes its shape to indicate what may be done:</para>
<para>Point the object or one part of it:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/02000095.jpg" width="9.95pt" depth="9.95pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/02000096.jpg" width="10.55pt" depth="9.95pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>Rotate:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/02000097.jpg" width="9.95pt" depth="9.95pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>Resize (exists also for the other directions):
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/02000098.jpg" width="9.95pt" depth="9.95pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/02000099.jpg" width="11.15pt" depth="10.55pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>Enlarge (used for text):
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0200009A.jpg" width="9.95pt" depth="11.15pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>Move:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0200009B.jpg" width="9.95pt" depth="9.95pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>Here are some examples of:</para>
<para>
Moving:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0200009C.jpg" width="74.5pt" depth="57.1pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
Resizing:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0200009D.jpg" width="105.5pt" depth="57.1pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
<para>
Rotating:
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0200009E.jpg" width="91.85pt" depth="56.5pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/0300009F.png" width="75.1pt" depth="57.1pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>With C++ Statements (Programmatically)</title>
<para>How would one move an object in a script? Since there is a tight
correspondence between what is seen on the screen and the object in memory,
changing the object changes it on the screen. For example, try to do:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">a.SetX1(0.9)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>This should change one of the coordinates of our line, but nothing happens
on the screen. Why is that? In short, the canvas is not updated with each change
for performance reasons. See "Updating the Pad".</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Selecting Objects</title>

<sect3>
<title>The Middle Mouse Button</title>
<para>Objects in a canvas, as well as in a pad, are stacked on top of each other
in the order they were drawn. Some objects may become “active” objects, which
mean they are reordered to be on top of the others. To interactively make an
object "active", you can use the middle mouse button. In case of canvases or
pads, the border becomes highlighted when it is active.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>With C++ Statements (Programmatically)</title>
<para>Frequently we want to draw in different canvases or pads. By default, the
objects are drawn in the active canvas. To activate a canvas you can use the
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::cd()</code>
method.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] c1-&gt;cd()
</programlisting>

</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Context Menus: the Right Mouse Button</title>
<para>The context menus are a way to interactively call certain methods of an
object. When designing a class, the programmer can add methods to the context
menu of the object by making minor changes to the header file.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Using Context Menus</title>
<para>On a ROOT canvas, you can right-click on any object and see the context
menu for it. The script <code>hsimple.C</code> draws a histogram. The image
below shows the context menus for some of the objects on the canvas. Next
picture shows that drawing a simple histogram involves as many as seven objects.
When selecting a method from the context menu and that method has options, the
user will be asked for numerical values or strings to fill in the option. For
example,
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetTitle</code>
will prompt you for a string to use for the axis title.</para>

<figure><title>Context menus of different objects in a canvas</title>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/030000A0.png" width="235.25pt" depth="214.75pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</figure>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Structure of the Context Menus</title>
<para>The curious reader will have noticed that each entry in the context menu
corresponds to a method of the class. Look for example to the menu named
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::xaxis</code>.
<code>xaxis</code> is the name of the object and
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> the name of its class. If we
look at the list of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> methods,
for example in
<uri xmlns:xlink="http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TAxis.html">http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TAxis.html</uri>,
we see the methods <code>SetTimeDisplay()</code> and<code> UnZoom()</code>,
which appear also in the context menu.</para>
<para>There are several divisions in the context menu, separated by lines. The
top division is a list of the class methods; the second division is a list of
the parent class methods. The subsequent divisions are the methods other parent
classes in case of multiple inheritance. For example, see the
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveText</code></emphasis><code>::title context
menu.</code> A <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveText</code></emphasis> inherits
from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttLine</code></emphasis>, which has the
method <code>SetLineAttributes()</code>.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Adding Context Menus for a Class</title>
<para>For a method to appear in the context menu of the object it has to be
marked by <code>// *MENU*</code> in the header file. Below is the line from
<code>TAttLine.h</code> that adds the <code>SetLineAttribute</code> method to
the context menu.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">virtual void  SetLineAttributes(); // *MENU*
</programlisting>

<para>Nothing else is needed, since CINT knows the classes and their methods. It
takes advantage of that to create the context menu on the fly when the object is
clicking on. If you click on an axis, ROOT will ask the interpreter what are the
methods of the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> and which
ones are set for being displayed in a context menu.</para>
<para>Now, how does the interpreter know this? Remember, when you build a class
that you want to use in the ROOT environment, you use <code>rootcint</code> that
builds the so-called stub functions and the dictionary. These functions and the
dictionary contain the knowledge of the used classes. To do this,
<code>rootcint</code> parses all the header files. ROOT has defined some special
syntax to inform CINT of certain things, this is done in the comments so that
the code still compiles with a C++ compiler.</para>
<para>For example, you have a class with a <code>Draw()</code> method, which
will display itself.  You would like a context menu to appear when on clicks on
the image of an object of this class. The recipe is the following:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
The class has to contain the <code>ClassDef/ClassImp</code> macros
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
For each method you want to appear in the context menu, put a comment after the
declaration containing <code>*MENU*</code> or <code>*TOGGLE*</code> depending on
the behavior you expect. One usually uses Set methods (setters). The
<code>*TOGGLE*</code> comment is used to toggle a <code>boolean</code> data
field. In that case, it is safe to call the data field <code>fMyBool</code>
where <code>MyBool</code> is the name of the setter <code>SetMyBool</code>.
Replace <code>MyBool</code> with your own <code>boolean</code> variable.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
You can specify arguments and the data members in which to store the arguments.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>For example:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">class MyClass : public TObject {
  private:
    int      fV1;   <emphasis role="italic">// first variable</emphasis>
    double   fV2;   <emphasis role="italic">// second variable</emphasis>
    public:
    int    GetV1() {return fV1;}
    double GetV2() {return fV2;}
    void   SetV1(int x1) { fV1 = x1;}     <emphasis role="italic">// *MENU*</emphasis>
    void   SetV2(double d2) { fV2 = d2;}  <emphasis role="italic">// *MENU*</emphasis>
    void   SetBoth(int x1, double d2) {fV1 = x1; fV2 = d2;}

ClassDef (MyClass,1)
}
</programlisting>

<para>To specify arguments:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU* *ARGS={x1=&gt;fV1}
</programlisting>

<para>This statement is in the comment field, after the *MENU*. If there is more
than one argument, these arguments are separated by commas, where fX1 and fY2
are data fields in the same class.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">void SetXXX(Int_t x1, Float_t y2); //*MENU* *ARGS={x1=&gt;fX1,y2=&gt;fY2}
</programlisting>

<para>If the arguments statement is present, the option dialog displayed when selecting <code>SetXXX field</code> will show the values of variables. We indicate to the system which argument corresponds to which data member of the class.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Executing Events when a Cursor Passes on Top of an Object</title>
<para>This paragraph is for class designers. When a class is designed, it is
often desirable to include drawing methods for it. We will have a more extensive
discussion about this, but drawing an object in a canvas or a pad consists in
"attaching" the object to that pad. When one uses <code>object.Draw()</code>,
the object is NOT painted at this moment. It is only attached to the active pad
or canvas.</para>
<para>Another method should be provided for the object to be painted, the
<code>Paint()</code> method. This is all explained in the next paragraph. As
well as <code>Draw()</code> and <code>Paint()</code>, other methods may be
provided by the designer of the class. When the mouse is moved or a button
pressed/released, the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis>
function named <code>HandleInput()</code> scans the list of objects in all it's
pads and for each object calls some standard methods to make the object react to
the event (mouse movement, click or whatever).</para>
<para>The second one is <code>DistanceToPrimitive(px,py)</code>. This function
computes a "distance" to an object from the mouse position at the pixel position
(<code>px</code>, <code>py</code>, see definition at the end of this paragraph)
and returns this distance in pixel units. The selected object will be the one
with the shortest computed distance. To see how this works, select the
"<code>Event Status</code>" item in the canvas "<code>Options</code>" menu. ROOT
will display one status line showing the picked object. If the picked object is,
for example, a histogram, the status line indicates the name of the histogram,
the position <code>x,y</code> in histogram coordinates, the channel number and
the channel content.</para>
<para>It is nice for the canvas to know what the closest object from the mouse
is, but it's even nicer to be able to make this object react. The third standard
method to be provided is <code>ExecuteEvent()</code>. This method actually does
the event reaction. Its prototype is where <code>px</code> and <code>py</code>
are the coordinates at which the event occurred, except if the event is a key
press, in which case <code>px</code> contains the key code.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">void ExecuteEvent(Int_t event, Int_t px, Int_t py);
</programlisting>

<para>Where <code>event</code> is the event that occurs and is one of the
following (defined in <code>Buttons.h</code>):</para>

<programlisting language="c++">kNoEvent,          kButton1Down,      kButton2Down,
kButton3Down,      kKeyDown,          kButton1Up,
kButton2Up,        kButton3Up,        kButton1Motion,
kButton2Motion,    kButton3Motion,    kKeyPress,
kButton1Locate,    kButton2Locate,    kButton3Locate,
kKeyUp,            kButton1Double,    kButton2Double,
kButton3Double,    kMouseMotion,      kMouseEnter,
kMouseLeave
</programlisting>

<para>We hope the names are self-explanatory.</para>
<para>Designing an <code>ExecuteEvent</code> method is not very easy, except if
one wants very basic treatment. We will not go into that and let the reader
refer to the sources of classes like
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TLine</code></emphasis> or
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TBox</code></emphasis>. Go and look at their
<code>ExecuteEvent</code> method! We can nevertheless give some reference to the
various actions that may be performed. For example, one often wants to change
the shape of the cursor when passing on top of an object. This is done with the
<code>SetCursor</code> method:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">gPad-&gt;SetCursor(cursor)
</programlisting>

<para>The argument <code>cursor</code> is the type of cursor. It may be:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">kBottomLeft,  kBottomRight,   kTopLeft,
kTopRight,    kBottomSide,   kLeftSide,
kTopSide,     kRightSide,    kMove,
kCross,       kArrowHor,     kArrowVer,
kHand,        kRotate,       kPointer,
kArrowRight,  kCaret,        kWatch
</programlisting>

<para>They are defined in <code>TVirtualX.h</code> and again we hope the names
are self-explanatory. If not, try them by designing a small class. It may derive
from something already known like
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TLine</code></emphasis>.</para>
<para>Note that the <code>ExecuteEvent()</code> functions may in turn; invoke
such functions for other objects, in case an object is drawn using other
objects. You can also exploit at best the virtues of inheritance. See for
example how the class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TArrow</code></emphasis>
(derived from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLine</code></emphasis>) use or
redefine the picking functions in its base class.</para>
<para>The last comment is that mouse position is always given in pixel units in
all these standard functions. <code>px=0</code> and <code>py=0</code>
corresponds to the top-left corner of the canvas. Here, we have followed the
standard convention in windowing systems. Note that user coordinates in a canvas
(pad) have the origin at the bottom-left corner of the canvas (pad). This is all
explained in the paragraph "The Coordinate Systems of a Pad".</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Graphical Containers: Canvas and Pad</title>
<para>We have talked a lot about canvases, which may be seen as windows. More
generally, a graphical entity that contains graphical objects is called a Pad. A
Canvas is a special kind of Pad. From now on, when we say something about pads,
this also applies to canvases. A pad (class
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>) is a graphical container in
the sense it contains other graphical objects like histograms and arrows. It may
contain other pads (sub-pads) as well. More technically, each pad has a linked
list of pointers to the objects it holds.</para>
<para>Drawing an object is nothing more than adding its pointer to this list.
Look for example at the code of
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1</code></emphasis><code>::Draw()</code>. It is
merely ten lines of code. The last statement is <code>AppendPad()</code>. This
statement calls method of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>
that just adds the pointer of the object, here a histogram, to the list of
objects attached to the current pad. Since this is a
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>’s method, every object may
be "drawn", which means attached to a pad. We can illustrate this by the
Figure 9-2. This image corresponds to the following structure:</para>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/060000A1.png" width="117.95pt" depth="78.2pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>

<figure><title>A histogram drawn in a pad</title>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/020000A2.jpg" width="253.85pt" depth="158.3pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</figure>

<para>When is the painting done then? The answer is: when needed. Every object
that derives from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis> has a
<code>Paint()</code> method. It may be empty, but for graphical objects, this
routine contains all the instructions to paint effectively it in the active pad.
Since a Pad has the list of objects it owns, it will call successively the
<code>Paint()</code> method of each object, thus re-painting the whole pad on
the screen. If the object is a sub-pad, its <code>Paint()</code> method will
call the <code>Paint()</code> method of the objects attached, recursively
calling <code>Paint()</code> for all the objects.</para>

<sect2>
<title>The Global Pad: gPad</title>
<para>When an object is drawn, it is always in the so-called active pad. For
every day use, it is comfortable to be able to access the active pad, whatever
it is. For that purpose, there is a global pointer, called
<emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"><code>gPad</code></emphasis></emphasis>.
It is always pointing to the active pad. If you want to change the fill color of
the active pad to blue but you do not know its name, do this.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] gPad-&gt;SetFillColor(38)
</programlisting>

<para>To get the list of colors, go to the paragraph "Color and color palettes"
or if you have an opened canvas, click on the <code>View</code> menu, selecting
the <code>Colors</code> item.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Finding an Object in a Pad</title>
<para>Now that we have a pointer to the active pad,
<emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"><code>gPad</code></emphasis></emphasis>
and that we know this pad contains some objects, it is sometimes interesting to
access one of those objects. The method <code>GetPrimitive()</code> of
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>, i.e.
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::GetPrimitive(const char* name)</code>
does exactly this. Since most of the objects that a pad contains derive from
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>, they have a name. The
following statement will return a pointer to the object
<code>myobjectname</code> and put that pointer into the variable
<code>obj</code>. As you can see, the type of returned pointer is
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>*</code>.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] obj = gPad-&gt;GetPrimitive("myobjectname")
(class TObject*)0x1063cba8
</programlisting>

<para>Even if your object is something more complicated, like a histogram
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1F</code></emphasis>, this is normal. A function
cannot return more than one type. So the one chosen was the lowest common
denominator to all possible classes, the class from which everything derives,
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>. How do we get the right
pointer then? Simply do a cast of the function output that will transform the
output (pointer) into the right type. For example if the object is a
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveLabel</code></emphasis>:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] obj = (TPaveLabel*)(gPad-&gt;GetPrimitive("myobjectname"))
(class TPaveLabel*)0x1063cba8
</programlisting>

<para>This works for all objects deriving from
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>. However, a question
remains. An object has a name if it derives from
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TNamed</code></emphasis>, not from
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>. For example, an arrow
(<emphasis role="bold"><code>TArrow</code></emphasis>) doesn't have a name. In
that case, the "name" is the name of the class. To know the name of an object,
just click with the right button on it. The name appears at the top of the
context menu. In case of multiple unnamed objects, a call to
<code>GetPrimitive("className")</code> returns the instance of the class that
was first created. To retrieve a later instance you can use
<code>GetListOfPrimitives()</code>, which returns a list of all the objects on
the pad. From the list you can select the object you need.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Hiding an Object</title>
<para>Hiding an object in a pad can be made by removing it from the list of
objects owned by that pad. This list is accessible by the
<code>GetListOfPrimitives()</code> method of
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>. This method returns a
pointer to a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TList</code></emphasis>. Suppose we get
the pointer to the object, we want to hide, call it <code>obj</code> (see
paragraph above). We get the pointer to the list:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">li = gPad-&gt;GetListOfPrimitives()</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>Then remove the object from this list:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>li-&gt;Remove(obj)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>The object will disappear from the pad as soon as the pad is updated (try
to resize it for example). If one wants to make the object reappear:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] obj-&gt;Draw()
</programlisting>

<para>Caution, this will not work with composed objects, for example many
histograms drawn on the same plot (with the option "<code>same</code>"). There
are other ways! Try to use the method described here for simple objects.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>The Coordinate Systems of a Pad</title>
<para>There are coordinate systems in a
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>: user coordinates, normalized
coordinates (NDC), and pixel coordinates.</para>

<figure><title>Pad coordinate systems</title>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/080000A3.png" width="253.25pt" depth="72.6pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</figure>

<sect3>
<title>The User Coordinate System</title>
<para>The most common is the user coordinate system. Most methods of
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> use the user coordinates, and
all graphic primitives have their parameters defined in terms of user
coordinates. By default, when an empty pad is drawn, the user coordinates are
set to a range from 0 to 1 starting at the lower left corner. At this point they
are equivalent of the NDC coordinates (see below). If you draw a high level
graphical object, such as a histogram or a function, the user coordinates are
set to the coordinates of the histogram. Therefore, when you set a point it will
be in the histogram coordinates.</para>
<para>For a newly created blank pad, one may use
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::Range</code> to set
the user coordinate system. This function is defined as:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">void Range(float x1,float y1,float x2,float y2)
</programlisting>

<para>The arguments <code>x1</code>, <code>x2</code> defines the new range in
the x direction, and the <code>y1</code>, <code>y2</code> define the new range
in the y-direction.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">TCanvas MyCanvas ("MyCanvas")</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;Range(-100,-100,100,100)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>This will set the active pad to have both coordinates to go from -100 to
100, with the center of the pad at (0,0). You can visually check the coordinates
by viewing the status bar in the canvas. To display the status bar select Event
Status entry in the View canvas menu.</para>

<figure><title>The status bar</title>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>The Normalized Coordinate System (NDC)</title>
<para>Normalized coordinates are independent of the window size and of the user
system. The coordinates range from 0 to 1 and (0, 0) corresponds to the
bottom-left corner of the pad. Several internal ROOT functions use the NDC
system (3D primitives, PostScript, log scale mapping to linear scale). You may
want to use this system if the user coordinates are not known ahead of
time.</para>
</sect3>

<title>The Pixel Coordinate System</title>
<para>The least common is the pixel coordinate system, used by functions such as
<code>DistanceToPrimitive()</code> and <code>ExecuteEvent()</code>. Its primary
use is for cursor position, which is always given in pixel coordinates. If
(<code>px,py</code>) is the cursor position, <code>px=0</code> and
<code>py=0</code> corresponds to the top-left corner of the pad, which is the
standard convention in windowing systems.</para>

<title>Using NDC for a particular Object</title>
<para>Most of the time, you will be using the user coordinate system. But
sometimes, you will want to use NDC. For example, if you want to draw text
always at the same place over a histogram, no matter what the histogram
coordinates are. There are two ways to do this. You can set the NDC for one
object or may convert NDC to user coordinates. Most graphical objects offer an
option to be drawn in NDC. For instance, a line
(<emphasis role="bold"><code>TLine</code></emphasis>) may be drawn in NDC by
using <code>DrawLineNDC()</code>. A latex formula or a text may use
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TText</code></emphasis><code>::SetNDC()</code> to be
drawn in NDC coordinates.</para>

<title>Converting between Coordinate Systems</title>
<para>There are a few utility functions in
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> to convert from one system of
coordinates to another. In the following table, a point is defined by
<code>(px,py)</code> in pixel coordinates, <code>(ux,uy)</code> in user
coordinates, <code>(ndcx,ndcy)</code> in normalized coordinates,
(<code>apx</code>, <code>apy</code>) are in absolute pixel
coordinates.</para>

<title>Dividing a Pad into Sub-pads</title>
<para>Dividing a pad into sub pads in order for instance to draw a few
histograms, may be done in two ways. The first is to build pad objects and to
draw them into a parent pad, which may be a canvas. The second is to
automatically divide a pad into horizontal and vertical sub pads.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Creating a Single Sub-pad</title>
<para>The simplest way to divide a pad is to build sub-pads in it. However, this
forces the user to explicitly indicate the size and position of those sub-pads.
Suppose we want to build a sub-pad in the active pad (pointed by
<emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"><code>gPad</code></emphasis></emphasis>).
First, we build it, using a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>
constructor:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">spad1 = new TPad("spad1","The first subpad",.1,.1,.5,.5)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>One gives the coordinates of the lower left point (0.1, 0.1) and of the
upper right one (0.5, 0.5). These coordinates are in NDC. This means that they
are independent of the user coordinates system, in particular if you have
already drawn for example a histogram in the mother pad. The only thing left is
to draw the pad:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">spad1-&gt;Draw()</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>If you want more sub-pads, you have to repeat this procedure as many times
as necessary.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Dividing a Canvas into Sub-Pads</title>
<para>The manual way of dividing a pad into sub-pads is sometimes very tedious.
There is a way to automatically generate horizontal and vertical sub-pads inside
a given pad.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">pad1-&gt;Divide(3,2)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<figure><title>Dividing a pad into 6 sub-pads</title>

<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/020000A6.jpg" width="164.5pt" depth="98.7pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</figure>

<para>If <code>pad1</code> is a pad then, it will divide the pad into 3 columns
of 2 sub-pads. The generated sub-pads get names <code>pad1_i</code> where the
index <code>i=1</code> to <code>nxm</code> (in our case <code>pad1_1</code>,
<code>pad1_2</code>...<code>pad1_6)</code>. The names <code>pad1_1 </code>etc…
correspond to new variables in CINT, so you may use them as soon as the executed
method was <code>pad-&gt;Divide()</code>. However, in a compiled program, one
has to access these objects. Remember that a pad contains other objects and that
these objects may themselves be pads. So we can use the
<code>GetPrimitive()</code> method:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">TPad* pad1_1 = (TPad*)(pad1-&gt;GetPrimitive("pad1_1"))
</programlisting>

<para>One question remains. In case one does an automatic divide, how one can
set the default margins between pads? This is done by adding two parameters to
<code>Divide()</code>, which are the margins in <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>pad1-&gt;Divide(3,2,0.1,0.1)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>The margins are here set to 10% of the parent pad width.</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Updating the Pad</title>
<para>For performance reasons, a pad is not updated with every change. For
example, changing the coordinates of the pad does not automatically redraw it.
Instead, the pad has a "bit-modified" that triggers a redraw. This bit is
automatically set by:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
Touching the pad with the mouse - for example resizing it with the mouse.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Finishing the execution of a script.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Adding a new primitive or modifying some primitives for example the name and
title of an object.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
You can also set the "bit-modified" explicitly with the <code>Modified</code>
method:
<programlisting language="c++"><emphasis role="italic">// the pad has changed</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">pad1-&gt;Modified()</emphasis>
<emphasis role="italic">// recursively update all modified pads:</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">c1-&gt;Update()</emphasis>
</programlisting>
A subsequent call to
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::Update()</code>
scans the list of sub-pads and repaints the pads declared modified.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>In compiled code or in a long macro, you may want to access an object
created during the paint process. To do so, you can force the painting with a
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::Update()</code>.
For example, a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGraph</code></emphasis> creates a
histogram (<emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1</code></emphasis>) to paint itself.
In this case the internal histogram obtained with
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TGraph</code></emphasis><code>::GetHistogram()</code>
is created only after the pad is painted. The pad is painted automatically after
the script is finished executing or if you force the painting with
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::Modified()</code>
followed by a
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::Update()</code>.
Note that it is not necessary to call
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::Modified()</code>
after a call to <code>Draw()</code>. The "bit-modified" is set automatically by
<code>Draw()</code>. A note about the "bit-modified" in sub pads: when you want
to update a sub pad in your canvas, you need to call
<code>pad-&gt;Modified()</code> rather than <code>canvas-&gt;Modified()</code>,
and follow it with a <code>canvas-&gt;Update()</code>. If you use
<code>canvas-&gt;Modified()</code>, followed by a call to
<code>canvas-&gt;Update()</code>, the sub pad has not been declared modified and
it will not be updated. Also note that a call to <code>pad-&gt;Update()</code>
where pad is a sub pad of canvas, calls <code>canvas-&gt;Update()</code> and
recursively updates all the pads on the canvas.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Making a Pad Transparent</title>
<para>As we will see in the paragraph "Fill Attributes", a fill style (type of
hatching) may be set for a pad.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">pad1-&gt;SetFillStyle(istyle)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>This is done with the <code>SetFillStyle</code> method where
<code>istyle</code> is a style number, defined in "Fill Attributes". A special
set of styles allows handling of various levels of transparency. These are
styles number 4000 to 4100, 4000 being fully transparent and 4100 fully opaque.
So, suppose you have an existing canvas with several pads. You create a new pad
(transparent) covering for example the entire canvas. Then you draw your
primitives in this pad. The same can be achieved with the graphics editor.
For example:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">.x tutorials/hist/h1draw.C</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">TPad *newpad=new TPad("newpad","Transparent pad",0,0,1,1);</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">newpad-&gt;SetFillStyle(4000);</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">newpad-&gt;Draw();</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">newpad-&gt;cd();</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="italic">// create some primitives, etc</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Setting the Log Scale</title>
<para>Setting the scale to logarithmic or linear is an attribute of the pad, not
the axis or the histogram. The scale is an attribute of the pad because you may
want to draw the same histogram in linear scale in one pad and in log scale in
another pad. Frequently, we see several histograms on top of each other in the
same pad. It would be very inconvenient to set the scale attribute for each
histogram in a pad.</para>
<para>Furthermore, if the logic was set in the histogram class (or each object)
the scale setting in each <code>Paint</code> method of all objects should be
tested.</para>
<para>If you have a pad with a histogram, a right-click on the pad, outside of
the histograms frame will convince you. The <code>SetLogx()</code>,
<code>SetLogy()</code> and <code>SetLogz()</code> methods are there. As you see,
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> defines log scale for the two
directions <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> plus <code>z</code> if you want to
draw a 3D representation of some function or histogram.</para>
<para>The way to set log scale in the x direction for the active pad is:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;SetLogx(1)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>To reset log in the z direction:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;SetLogz(0)</emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>If you have a divided pad, you need to set the scale on each of the
sub-pads. Setting it on the containing pad does not automatically propagate to
the sub-pads. Here is an example of how to set the log scale for the x-axis on a
canvas with four sub-pads:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">TCanvas MyCanvas("MyCanvas","My Canvas")</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">MyCanvas-&gt;Divide(2,2)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">MyCanvas-&gt;cd(1)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;SetLogx()</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">MyCanvas-&gt;cd(2)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;SetLogx()</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">MyCanvas-&gt;cd(3)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">gPad-&gt;SetLogx()</emphasis>
</programlisting>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>WaitPrimitive method</title>
<para>When the
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis><code>::WaitPrimitive()</code>
method is called with no arguments, it will wait until a double click or any key
pressed is executed in the canvas. A call to <code>gSystem-&gt;Sleep(10)</code>
has been added in the loop to avoid consuming at all the CPU. This new option is
convenient when executing a macro. By adding statements like:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">canvas-&gt;WaitPrimitive();
</programlisting>

<para>You can monitor the progress of a running macro, stop it at convenient
places with the possibility to interact with the canvas and resume the execution
with a double click or a key press.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Locking the Pad</title>
<para>You can make the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>
non-editable. Then no new objects can be added, and the existing objects and the
pad can not be changed with the mouse or programmatically. By default the
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> is editable.</para>

<title>Graphical Objects</title>
<para>In this paragraph, we describe the various simple 2D graphical objects
defined in ROOT. Usually, one defines these objects with their constructor and
draws them with their <code>Draw()</code> method. Therefore, the examples will
be very brief. Most graphical objects have line and fill attributes (color,
width) that will be described in “Graphical objects attributes”. If the user
wants more information, the class names are given and he may refer to the online
developer documentation. This is especially true for functions and methods that
set and get internal values of the objects described here. By default 2D
graphical objects are created in User Coordinates with (0, 0) in the lower left
corner.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Lines, Arrows and Polylines</title>
<para>The simplest graphical object is a line. It is implemented in the
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TLine</code></emphasis> class. The line constructor
is:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">TLine(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2)
</programlisting>

<para>The arguments <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>,
<code>y2</code> are the coordinates of the first and second point. It can be
used:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">root[] <emphasis role="bold">l = new TLine(0.2,0.2,0.8,0.3)</emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold">l-&gt;Draw()</emphasis>

<para>The arrow constructor is:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">TArrow(Double_t x1, Double_t y1,
       Double_t x2, Double_t y2,
       Float_t arrowsize, Option_t *option)
</programlisting>

<para>It defines an arrow between points <code>x1,y1</code> and
<code>x2,y2</code>. The arrow size is in percentage of the pad height. The
<code>option</code> parameter has the following meanings:</para>

<title>Curly and Wavy Lines for Feynman Diagrams</title>
<para>This is a peculiarity of particle physics, but we do need sometimes to
draw Feynman diagrams. Our friends working in banking can skip this part. A set
of classes implements curly or wavy poly-lines typically used to draw Feynman
diagrams. Amplitudes and wavelengths may be specified in the constructors, via
commands or interactively from context menus. These classes are
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TCurlyLine</code></emphasis> and
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TCurlyArc</code></emphasis>. These classes make use
of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPolyLine</code></emphasis> by inheritance;
<code>ExecuteEvent</code> methods are highly inspired from the methods used in
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPolyLine</code></emphasis> and
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TArc</code></emphasis>.</para>

<title>Text and Latex Mathematical Expressions</title>
<para>Text displayed in a pad may be embedded into boxes, called paves
(<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveLabel</code></emphasis>), or titles of graphs
or many other objects but it can live a life of its own. All text displayed in
ROOT graphics is an object of class
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TText</code></emphasis>. For a physicist, it will be
most of the time a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis>
expression (which derives from
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TText</code></emphasis>).
<emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> has been conceived to draw
mathematical formulas or equations. Its syntax is very similar to the Latex in
mathematical mode.</para>

<title>Subscripts and Superscripts</title>
<para>Subscripts and superscripts are made with the <code>_</code> and
<code>^</code> commands. These commands can be combined to make complex
subscript and superscript expressions. You may choose how to display subscripts
and superscripts using the 2 functions <code>SetIndiceSize(Double_t)</code> and
<code>SetLimitIndiceSize(Int_t)</code>. Examples of what can be obtained using
subscripts and superscripts:</para>

<title>Text in a Pad</title>
<para>Text displayed in a pad may be embedded into boxes, called paves, or may be drawn alone. In any case, it is recommended to use a Latex expression, which is covered in the previous paragraph. Using <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> is valid whether the text is embedded or not. In fact, you will use Latex expressions without knowing it since it is the standard for all the embedded text. A pave is just a box with a border size and a shadow option. The options common to all types of paves and used when building those objects are the following:</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>T"</code> top frame</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>B"</code> bottom frame</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>R"</code> right frame</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>L"</code> left frame</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>NDC"</code> <code>x1,y1,x2,y2</code> are given in NDC</para>
<para><code>option</code> = “<code>ARC"</code> corners are rounded</para>
<para>We will see the practical use of these options in the description of the more functional objects like <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveLabel</code></emphasis><code>s</code>. There are several categories of paves containing text: <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveLabel</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveText</code></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPavesText</code></emphasis>. <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPaveLabel</code></emphasis><code>s</code> are panels containing one line of text. They are used for labeling.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TPaveLabel(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2, const char *label,
Option_t *option)
</programlisting>

<para>Where (<code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>) are the coordinates of the bottom left corner, <code>(x2,y2)</code> - coordinates of the upper right corner. “<code>label</code>” is the text to be displayed and “option” is the drawing option, described above. By default, the border size is 5 and the option is “<code>br</code>”. If one wants to set the border size to some other value, one may use the method <code>SetBorderSize()</code>. For example, suppose we have a histogram, which limits are (-100,100) in the x direction and (0, 1000) in the y direction. The following lines will draw a label in the center of the histogram, with no border. If one wants the label position to be independent of the histogram coordinates, or user coordinates, one can use the option “<code>NDC</code>”. See “The Coordinate Systems of a Pad”.</para>

This may be useful for example in the case one wants to draw two axis for the same plot, one on the left and one on the right.</para>
<para>For historical reasons, there are two classes representing axis. <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> * <code>axis</code> is the axis object, which will be returned when calling the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1</code></emphasis><code>::GetAxis()</code> method.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TAxis *axis = histo-&gt;GetXaxis()
</programlisting>

<para>Of course, you may do the same for <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>-axis. The graphical representation of an axis is done with the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> class. The histogram classes and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGraph</code></emphasis> generate instances of this class. This is internal and the user should not have to see it.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Axis Title</title>
<para>The axis title is set, as with all named objects, by</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
axis-&gt;SetTitle("Whatever title you want");
</programlisting>

<para>When the axis is embedded into a histogram or a graph, one has to first extract the axis object:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
h-&gt;GetXaxis()-&gt;SetTitle("Whatever title you want")
</programlisting>

</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Axis Options and Characteristics</title>
<para>The axis options are most simply set with the styles. The available style options controlling specific axis options are the following:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TAxis *axis = histo-&gt;GetXaxis();
axis-&gt;SetAxisColor(Color_t color = 1);
axis-&gt;SetLabelColor(Color_t color = 1);
axis-&gt;SetLabelFont(Style_t font = 62);
axis-&gt;SetLabelOffset(Float_t offset = 0.005);
axis-&gt;SetLabelSize(Float_t size = 0.04);
axis-&gt;SetNdivisions(Int_t n = 510, Bool_t optim = kTRUE);
axis-&gt;SetNoExponent(Bool_t noExponent = kTRUE);
axis-&gt;SetTickLength(Float_t length = 0.03);
axis-&gt;SetTitleOffset(Float_t offset = 1);
axis-&gt;SetTitleSize(Float_t size = 0.02);
</programlisting>

<para>The getters corresponding to the described setters are also available. The general options, not specific to axis, as for instance <code>SetTitleTextColor()</code> are valid and do have an effect on axis characteristics.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Setting the Number of Divisions</title>
<para>Use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetNdivisions(ndiv,optim)</code>         to set the number of divisions for an axis. The <code>ndiv</code> and <code>optim</code> are as follows:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>ndiv</code> = <code>N1 + 100*N2 + 10000*N3</code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>N1 =</code> number of first divisions.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>N2 =</code> number of secondary divisions.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>N3 =</code> number of tertiary divisions.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>    <code>optim = kTRUE </code>    (default), the divisions’ number will be optimized around the specified value.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>    <code>optim = kFALSE, </code>    or n &lt; 0, the axis will be forced to use exactly n divisions.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For example:</para>
<para><code>ndiv = 0</code>: no tick marks.</para>
<para><code>ndiv = 2</code>: 2 divisions, one tick mark in the middle of the axis.</para>
<para><code>ndiv = 510</code>: 10 primary divisions, 5 secondary divisions</para>
<para><code>ndiv = -10 </code>: exactly 10 primary divisions</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Zooming the Axis</title>
<para>You can use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetRange</code> or <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetRangeUser</code> to zoom the axis.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TAxis::SetRange(Int_t binfirst,Int_t binlast)
</programlisting>

<para>The <code>SetRange</code> method parameters are bin numbers. They are not axis. For example if a histogram plots the values from 0 to 500 and has 100 bins, <code>SetRange(0,10)</code> will cover the values 0 to 50. The parameters for <code>SetRangeUser</code> are user coordinates. If the start or end is in the middle of a bin the resulting range is approximation. It finds the low edge bin for the start and the high edge bin for the high.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TAxis::SetRangeUser(Axis_t ufirst,Axis_t ulast)
</programlisting>

<para>Both methods, <code>SetRange</code> and <code>SetRangeUser</code>, are in the context menu of any axis and can be used interactively. In addition, you can zoom an axis interactively: click on the axis on the start, drag the cursor to the end, and release the mouse button.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Drawing Axis Independently of Graphs or Histograms</title>
<para>An axis may be drawn independently of a histogram or a graph. This may be useful to draw for example a supplementary axis for a graph. In this case, one has to use the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> class, the graphical representation of an axis. One may use the standard constructor for this kind of objects:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TGaxis(Double_t xmin,Double_t ymin,Double_t xmax,Double_t ymax,Double_t wmin,
Double_t wmax,Int_t ndiv = 510,Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength = 0)
</programlisting>

<para>The arguments <code>xmin, ymin</code> are the coordinates of the axis' start in the user coordinates system, <code>and xmax, ymax</code> are the end coordinates. The arguments <code>wmin</code> and <code>wmax</code> are the minimum (at the start) and maximum (at the end) values to be represented on the axis; <code>ndiv</code> is the number of divisions. The options, given by the “<code>chopt</code>” string are the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>chopt = 'G'</code>: logarithmic scale, default is linear.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>chopt = 'B'</code>: Blank axis (it is useful to superpose the axis).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Instead of the <code>wmin,wmax</code> arguments of the normal constructor, i.e. the limits of the axis, the name of a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TF1</code></emphasis> function can be specified. This function will be used to map the user coordinates to the axis values and ticks.</para>
<para>The constructor is the following:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TGaxis(Double_t xmin,Double_t ymin,Double_t xmax,Double_t ymax,
const char* funcname,Int_t ndiv=510,Option_t* chopt,Double_t gridlength=0)
</programlisting>

<para>In such a way, it is possible to obtain exponential evolution of the tick marks position, or even decreasing. In fact, anything you like.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Orientation of Tick Marks on Axis</title>
<para>Tick marks are normally drawn on the positive side of the axis, however, if <code>xmin = xmax</code>, then negative.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>chopt = '+</code>’<code>:</code> tick marks are drawn on Positive side. (Default)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>chopt = '-</code>’<code>:</code> tick marks are drawn on the negative side.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>chopt =</code> '+-’: tick marks are drawn on both sides of the axis.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>chopt = </code>‘<code>U</code>’<code>:</code> unlabeled axis, default is labeled.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Labels</title>

<sect3>
<title>Position</title>
<para>Labels are normally drawn on side opposite to tick marks. However, <code>chopt = '='</code>: on Equal side. The function <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::CenterLabels()</code> sets the bit <code>kCenterLabels</code> and it is visible from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> context menu. It centers the bin labels and it makes sense only when the number of bins is equal to the number of tick marks. The class responsible for drawing the axis <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> inherits this property.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Orientation</title>
<para>Labels are normally drawn parallel to the axis. However, if <code>xmin = xmax</code>, then they are drawn orthogonal, and if <code>ymin=ymax</code> they are drawn parallel.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Labels for Exponents</title>
<para>By default, an exponent of the form 10^N is used when the label values are either all very small or very large. One can disable the exponent by calling:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
<code>TAxis::SetNoExponent(kTRUE)</code>
</programlisting>

<para>Note that this option is implicitly selected if the number of digits to draw a label is less than the <code>fgMaxDigits</code> global member. If the property <code>SetNoExponent</code> was set in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> (via <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetNoExponent)</code>, the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> will inherit this property. <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> is the class responsible for drawing the axis. The method <code>SetNoExponent</code> is also available from the axis context menu.</para>

<title>Number of Digits in Labels</title>
<para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis><code>::fgMaxDigits</code> is the maximum number of digits permitted for the axis labels above which the notation with 10^N is used. It must be greater than 0. By default <code>fgMaxDigits</code> is 5 and to change it use the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis><code>::SetMaxDigits</code>         method. For example to set <code>fgMaxDigits</code> to accept 6 digits and accept numbers like 900000 on an axis call:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TGaxis::SetMaxDigits(6)

<title>Label Formatting</title>
<para>Blank characters are stripped, and then the label is correctly aligned. The dot, if last character of the string, is also stripped. In the following, we have some parameters, like tick marks length and characters height (in percentage of the length of the axis, in user coordinates). The default values are as follows:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Primary tick marks: 3.0 %</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Secondary tick marks: 1.5 %</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Third order tick marks: .75 %</para></listitem>

<title>Stripping Decimals</title>
<para>Use the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis><code>::SetStripDecimals</code> to strip decimals when drawing axis labels. By default, the option is set to true, and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis><code>::PaintAxis</code> removes trailing zeros after the dot in the axis labels, e.g. {0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, etc.}</para>

<programlisting language="c++">

</programlisting>

<para>If this function is called with <code>strip=kFALSE</code>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis><code>::PaintAxis()</code> will draw labels with the same number of digits after the dot, e.g. {0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc.}</para>

<title>Axis with Time Units</title>
<para>Histograms' axis can be defined as "time axis". To do that it is enough to activate the <code>SetTimeDisplay</code> attribute on a given axis. If <code>h</code> is a histogram, it is done the following way:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
h-&gt;GetXaxis()-&gt;SetTimeDisplay(1);    <emphasis role="italic"><code>// X axis is a time axis</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>Two parameters can be adjusted in order to define time axis: the time format and the time offset.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Time Format</title>
<para>It defines the format of the labels along the time axis. It can be changed using the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAxis</code></emphasis> method <code>SetTimeFormat</code>. The time format is the one used by the C function <code>strftime()</code>. It is a string containing the following formatting characters:</para>
<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">
<colspec colwidth="1440*" colname="column-1"/>

<para>The other characters are output as is. For example to have a format like <code>dd/mm/yyyy</code> one should do:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
h-&gt;GetXaxis()-&gt;SetTimeFormat("%d/%m/%Y");
</programlisting>

<para>If the time format is not defined, a default one will be computed automatically.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Time Offset</title>
<para>This is a time in seconds in the UNIX standard UTC format (the universal time, not the local one), defining the starting date of a histogram axis. This date should be greater than 01/01/95 and is given in seconds. There are three ways to define the time offset:</para>
<para>1. By setting the global default time offset:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TDatime da(2003,02,28,12,00,00);
gStyle-&gt;SetTimeOffset(da.Convert());
</programlisting>

<para>If no time offset is defined for a particular axis, the default time offset will be used. In the example above, notice the usage of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TDatime</code></emphasis> to translate an explicit date into the time in seconds required by <code>SetTimeFormat</code>.</para>
<para>2. By setting a time offset to a particular axis:</para>
<para/>

<programlisting language="c++">
TDatime dh(2001,09,23,15,00,00);
h-&gt;GetXaxis()-&gt;SetTimeOffset(dh.Convert());
</programlisting>

<para>3. Together with the time format using <code>SetTimeFormat</code>. The time offset can be specified using the control character %F after the normal time format. <code>%F</code> is followed by the date in the format: <code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss</code>.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
h-&gt;GetXaxis()-&gt;SetTimeFormat("%d/%m/%y%F2000-02-28 13:00:01");
</programlisting>

<para>Notice that this date format is the same used by the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TDatime</code></emphasis> function <code>AsSQLString</code>. If needed, this function can be used to translate a time in seconds into a character string which can be appended after <code>%F</code>. If the time format is not specified (before <code>%F</code>) the automatic one will be used. The following example illustrates the various possibilities.</para>
<para/>
<para/>

<programlisting language="c++">

<para>The output is shown in the figure below. If a time axis has no specified time offset, the global time offset will be stored in the axis data structure. The histogram limits are in seconds. If <code>wmin</code> and <code>wmax</code> are the histogram limits, the time axis will spread around the time offset value from <code>TimeOffset+wmin</code> to <code>TimeOffset+wmax</code>. Until now all examples had a lowest value equal to 0. The following example demonstrates how to define the histogram limits relatively to the time offset value.</para>

<para>The output is shown in the next figure. Usually time axes are created automatically via histograms, but one may also want to draw a time axis outside a "histogram context". Therefore, it is useful to understand how <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGaxis</code></emphasis> works for such axis. The time offset can be defined using one of the three methods described before. The time axis will spread around the time offset value. Actually, it will go from <code>TimeOffset+wmin</code> to <code>TimeOffset+wmax</code> where <code>wmin</code> and <code>wmax</code> are the minimum and maximum values (in seconds) of the axis. Let us take again an example. Having defined "2003, February 28 at 12h”, we would like to see the axis a day before and a day after.</para>

<para>the "<code>t</code>" option (in lower case) means it is a "time axis". The axis goes form 100000 seconds before <code>TimeOffset </code>and 150000 seconds after. So the complete macro is:</para>

<title>Text Attributes</title>
<para>When a class contains text or derives from a text class, it needs to be able to set text attributes like font type, size, and color. To do so, the class inherits from the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis> class (a secondary inheritance), which defines text attributes. <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TText</code></emphasis> inherit from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis>.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Setting Text Alignment</title>
<para>Text alignment may be set by a method call. What is said here applies to all objects deriving from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis>, and there are many. We will take an example that may be transposed to other types. Suppose "<code>la</code>" is a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> object. The alignment is set with:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>la-&gt;SetTextAlign(align)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>The parameter <code>align</code> is a <code>short</code> describing the alignment:</para>
<para>
<code>align  = 10*HorizontalAlign + VerticalAlign</code></para>
<para>For horizontal alignment, the following convention applies:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1 = left</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2 = centered</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3 = right</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For vertical alignment, the following convention applies:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>1 = bottom</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>2 = centered</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>3 = top</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For example, align: 11 = left adjusted and bottom adjusted; 32 = right adjusted and vertically centered.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Setting Text Angle</title>
<para>Use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis><code>::SetTextAngle</code> to set the text angle. The <code>angle</code> is the degrees of the horizontal.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>la-&gt;SetTextAngle(angle)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Setting Text Color</title>
<para>Use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis><code>::SetTextColor</code> to set the text color. The <code>color</code> is the color index. The colors are described in "Color and Color Palettes".</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] la-&gt;SetTextColor(color)
</programlisting>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Setting Text Font</title>
<para>Use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis><code>::SetTextFont</code> to set the font. The parameter font is the font code, combining the font and precision:   <code>font = 10 * fontID + precision</code></para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] la-&gt;SetTextFont(font)
</programlisting>

<para>The table below lists the available fonts. The font IDs must be between 1 and 14. The precision can be:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Precision = 0 fast hardware fonts (steps in the size)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Precision = 1 scalable and rotate-able hardware fonts (see below)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Precision = 2 scalable and rotate-able hardware fonts</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>When precision 0 is used, only the original non-scaled system fonts are used. The fonts have a minimum (4) and maximum (37) size in pixels. These fonts are fast and are of good quality. Their size varies with large steps and they cannot be rotated. Precision 1 and 2 fonts have a different behavior depending if True Type Fonts (TTF) are used or not. If TTF are used, you always get very good quality scalable and rotate-able fonts. However, TTF are slow. Precision 1 and 2 fonts have a different behavior for PostScript in case of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> objects:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>With precision 1, the PostScript text uses the old convention (<code>see </code><emphasis role="bold"><code>TPostScript</code></emphasis>) for some special characters to draw sub and superscripts or Greek text.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>With precision 2, the "PostScript" special characters are drawn as such. To draw sub and superscripts it is highly recommended to use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis> objects instead.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For example: <code>font = 62 </code>is the font with ID <code>6 </code>and precision <code>2</code>.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TColor(Int_t color,Float_t r,Float_t g,Float_t b,const char* name)
</programlisting>

<para>One has to give the color number and the three Red, Green, Blue values, each being defined from 0 (min) to 1(max). An optional name may be given. When built, this color is automatically added to the existing list of colors. If the color number already exists, one has to extract it from the list and redefine the RGB values. This may be done for example with:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>color=(TColor</code></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><code>*)(gROOT</code></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><code>-&gt;GetListOfColors()-&gt;At(index_color))</code></emphasis>
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>color-&gt;SetRGB(r,g,b)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>Where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code> and <code>b</code> go from 0 to 1 and <code>index_color</code> is the color number you wish to change.</para>

<title>Color Palette (for Histograms)</title>
<para>Defining one color at a time may be tedious. The histogram classes (see Draw Options) use the color palette. For example,         <emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1</code></emphasis><code>::Draw("col")</code> draws a 2-D histogram with cells represented by a box filled with a color <code>CI</code> function of the cell content. If the cell content is <code>N</code>, the color <code>CI</code> used will be the color number in <code>colors[N]</code>. If the maximum cell content is <code>&gt;ncolors</code>, all cell contents are scaled to <code>ncolors</code>. The current color palette does not have a class or global object of its own. It is defined in the current style as an array of color numbers. The current palette can be changed with:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
<code>TStyle::SetPalette(Int_t ncolors,Int_t*color_indexes). </code>
</programlisting>

<para>By default, or if <code>ncolors &lt;= 0</code>, a default palette (see above) of 50 colors is defined. The colors defined in this palette are good for coloring pads, labels, and other graphic objects. If <code>ncolors</code>         <code>&gt; 0</code> and <code>colors = 0</code>, the default palette is used with a maximum of <code>ncolors</code>. If <code>ncolors == 1 &amp;&amp; colors == 0</code>, then a pretty palette with a spectrum <code>Violet-&gt;Red</code> is created. It is recommended to use this pretty palette when drawing lego(s), surfaces or contours. For example, to set the current palette to the “<code>pretty</code>” one, do:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>gStyle-&gt;SetPalette(1)</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>A more complete example is shown below. It illustrates the definition of a custom palette. You can adapt it to suit your needs. In case you use it for contour coloring, with the current color/contour algorithm, always define two more colors than the number of contours.</para>

<title>Copy and Paste</title>
<para>You can make a copy of a canvas using <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::DrawClonePad</code>. This method is unique to <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis>. It clones the entire canvas to the active pad. There is a more general method <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>::DrawClone</code>, which all objects descendents of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>, specifically all graphic objects inherit. Below are two examples, one to show the use of <code>DrawClonePad</code> and the other to show the use of <code>DrawClone</code>.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Using the GUI</title>
<para>In this example we will copy an entire canvas to a new one with <code>DrawClonePad</code>. Run the script <code>draw2dopt.C</code>.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] .x tutorials/hist/draw2dopt.C
</programlisting>

<para>This creates a canvas with 2D histograms. To make a copy of the canvas follow the steps:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Right-click on it to bring up the context menu</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Select <code>DrawClonePad</code></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>This copies the entire canvas and all its sub-pads to a new canvas. The copied canvas is a deep clone, and all the objects on it are copies and independent of the original objects. For instance, change the fill on one of the original histograms, and the cloned histogram retains its attributes. <code>DrawClonePad</code> will copy the canvas to the active pad; the target does not have to be a canvas. It can also be a pad on a canvas.</para>

</para>
</figure>

<para>If you want to copy and paste a graphic object from one canvas or pad to another canvas or pad, you can do so with <code>DrawClone</code> method inherited from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis>. All graphics objects inherit the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>::DrawClone</code> method. In this example, we create a new canvas with one histogram from each of the canvases from the script <code>draw2dopt.C</code>.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Start a new ROOT session and execute the script <code>draw2dopt.C</code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Select a canvas displayed by the script, and create a new canvas <code>c1</code> from the File menu.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Make sure that the target canvas (<code>c1</code>) is the active one by middle clicking on it. If you do this step right after step 2, c1 will be active.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Select the pad with the first histogram you want to copy and paste.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Right click on it to show the context menu, and select <code>DrawClone</code>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Leave the option blank and hit OK.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Repeat these steps for one histogram on each of the canvases created by the script, until you have one pad from each type. If you wanted to put the same annotation on each of the sub pads in the new canvas, you could use <code>DrawClone</code> to do so. Here we added the date to each pad. The steps to this are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Create the label in on of the pads with the graphics editor.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Middle-click on the target pad to make it the active pad</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Use <code>DrawClone</code> method of the label to draw it in each of the other panels.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The option in the <code>DrawClone</code> method argument is the Draw option for a histogram or graph. A call to <emphasis role="bold"><code>TH1</code></emphasis><code>::DrawClone</code> can clone the histogram with a different draw option.</para>

<title>Programmatically</title>
<para>To copy and paste the four pads from the command line or in a script you would execute the following statements:</para>

<title>Legends</title>
<para>Legends for a graph are obtained with a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLegend</code></emphasis> object. This object points to markers, lines, boxes, histograms, graphs and represent their marker, line, fill attributes. Any object that has a marker or line or fill attribute may have an associated legend. A <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLegend</code></emphasis> is a panel with several entries (class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLegendEntry</code></emphasis>) and is created by the constructor</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TLegend(Double_t x1,Double_t y1,Double_t x2,Double_t y2,const char *header,
Option_t *option)
</programlisting>

<para>The legend is defined with default coordinates, border size and option. The legend coordinates (NDC) in the current pad are <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>x2</code>, <code>y2</code>. The default text attributes for the legend are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Alignment= 12 left adjusted and vertically centered</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Angle = 0 (degrees)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Font = helvetica-medium-r-normal scalable font = 42, and bold = 62 for title</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The title is a regular entry and supports <emphasis role="bold"><code>TLatex</code></emphasis>. The default is no title (<code>header = 0</code>). The options are the same as for <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPave</code></emphasis>; by default, they are "<code>brNDC</code>". Once the legend box is created, one has to add the text with the <code>AddEntry()</code> method:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TLegendEntry* TLegend::AddEntry(TObject *obj, const char *label,Option_t *option)
</programlisting>

<para>The parameters are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>*obj </code>is a pointer to an object having marker, line, or fill attributes (a histogram, or a graph)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>label</code> is the label to be associated to the object</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>”F” draw a box with fill associated with fill attributes of <code>obj</code>, if <code>obj</code> inherits <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttFill</code></emphasis>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>One may also use the other form of the method <code>AddEntry</code>:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TLegendEntry* TLegend::AddEntry(const char *name,const char *label,                    Option_t *option)
</programlisting>

<para>Here <code>name</code> is the name of the object in the pad. Other parameters are as in the previous case. Next example shows how to create a legend:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
leg = new TLegend(0.4,0.6,0.89,0.89);
leg-&gt;AddEntry(fun1,"One Theory","l");
leg-&gt;AddEntry(fun3,"Another Theory","f");

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Select to print the canvas in the PostScript file format from the File menu / Save or Save As menu entries. By default, a PostScript file is generated, if you do not specify the file format.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Click in the canvas area, near the edges, with the right mouse button and select the Print context menu entry. This will generate a file of canvas pointed to by c1. You can select the name of the PostScript file. If the file name is <code>xxx.ps</code>, you will generate a PostScript file named <code>xxx.ps</code>. If the file name is <code>xxx.eps</code>, you generate an encapsulated Postscript file instead. In your program (or script), you can type:</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<programlisting language="c++">

<para>You do not need to specify this second parameter; you can indicate by the filename extension what format you want to save a canvas in (i.e. <code>canvas.ps</code>, <code>canvas.gif</code>, <code>canvas.C</code>, etc).</para>
<para>The size of the PostScript picture, by default, is computed to keep the aspect ratio of the picture on the screen, where the size along <code>x</code> is always 20 cm. You can set the size of the PostScript picture before generating the picture with a command such as:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TPostScript myps("myfile.ps",111)
myps.Range(xsize,ysize);
object-&gt;Draw();

<listitem><para>112 - <code>ps</code>  <code>landscape</code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>113 - <code>eps</code></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>You can set the default paper size with:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
gStyle-&gt;SetPaperSize(xsize,ysize);
</programlisting>

<para>You can resume writing again in this file with <code>myps.Open()</code>. Note that you may have several Post Script files opened simultaneously. Use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPostScript</code></emphasis><code>::Text(x,y,"string")</code> to add text to a postscript file. This method writes the string in quotes into a PostScript file at position <code>x, y</code> in world coordinates.</para>

<title>Special Characters</title>
<para>The following characters have a special action on the PostScript file:</para>
<itemizedlist>

</itemizedlist>
<para>These special characters are printed as such on the screen. To generate one of these characters on the PostScript file, you must escape it with the escape character "@". The use of these special characters is illustrated in several scripts referenced by the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPostScript</code></emphasis> constructor.</para>

<title>Writing Several Canvases to the Same PostScript File</title>
<para>The following sequence writes the canvas to "<code>c1.ps</code>" and closes the postscript file:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TCanvas c1("c1");
h1.Draw();
c1.Print("c1.ps");
</programlisting>

<para>If the Postscript file name finishes with "<code>(</code>", the file remains opened (it is not closed). If the Postscript file name finishes with "<code>)</code>" and the file has been opened with "<code>(</code>", the file is closed.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">

<code>   h2.Draw();</code>
<code>   c1.Print("c1.ps");   </code><emphasis role="italic"><code>// canvas is added to "c1.ps"</code></emphasis>
<code>   h3.Draw();</code>
<code>   c1.Print("c1.ps)");  </code><emphasis role="italic"><code>//canvas is added to "c1.ps"; ps file is closed</code></emphasis>
<code>}</code>
</programlisting>

<para>The <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::Print("file.ps(")</code>         mechanism is very useful, but it can be a little inconvenient to have the action of opening/closing a file being atomic with printing a page. Particularly if pages are being generated in some loop, one needs to detect the special cases of first and last page. The "<code>[</code>" and "<code>]</code>" can be used instead of "<code>(</code>" and "<code>)</code>" as shown in the next example.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
<code>c1.Print("file.ps[");      </code><emphasis role="italic"><code>// no actual ptint; just open file.ps</code></emphasis>

<code>}  // end loop</code>
<code>c1.Print("file.ps]");     </code><emphasis role="italic"><code>// no actual ptint; just close file.ps</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>The following script illustrates how to open a postscript file and draw several pictures. The generation of a new postscript page is automatic when <emphasis role="bold"><code>TCanvas</code></emphasis><code>::Clear</code> is called by <code>object-&gt;Draw()</code>.</para>

<title>Create or Modify a Style</title>
<para>All objects that can be drawn in a pad inherit from one or more attribute classes like <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttLine</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttFill</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttText</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAttMarker</code></emphasis>. When objects are created, their default attributes are taken from the current style. The current style is an object of the class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis> and can be referenced via the global variable <emphasis role="italic"><emphasis role="bold"><code>gStyle</code></emphasis></emphasis> (in <code>TStyle.h</code>). See the class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis> for a complete list of the attributes that can be set in one style.</para>
<para>ROOT provides several styles called:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>"<code>Default</code>"    - the default style</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>"<code>Plain</code>" - the simple style (black and white)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>"<code>Bold</code>" - bolder lines</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>"<code>Video</code>" - suitable for html output or screen viewing</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The "<code>Default</code>" style is created by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TStyle *default = new TStyle("Default","Default Style");
</programlisting>

<para>The "<code>Plain</code>" style can be used if you want to get a "conventional" PostScript output or if you are working on a monochrome display. The following example shows how to create it.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TStyle *plain  = new TStyle("Plain","Plain Style(no colors/fill areas)");
plain-&gt;SetCanvasBorderMode(0);
plain-&gt;SetPadBorderMode(0);
plain-&gt;SetPadColor(0);
plain-&gt;SetCanvasColor(0);
plain-&gt;SetTitleColor(0);
plain-&gt;SetStatColor(0);
</programlisting>

<para>You can set the current style by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
gROOT-&gt;SetStyle(style_name);
</programlisting>

<para>You can get a pointer to an existing style by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TStyle *style = gROOT-&gt;GetStyle(style_name);
</programlisting>

<para>You can create additional styles by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TStyle *st1 = new TStyle("st1","my style");
st1-&gt;Set...
st1-&gt;cd();<emphasis role="italic"><code>  // this becomes now the current style gStyle</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>In your <code>rootlogon.C</code> file, you can redefine the default parameters via statements like:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
gStyle-&gt;SetStatX(0.7);
gStyle-&gt;SetStatW(0.2);
gStyle-&gt;SetLabelOffset(1.2);
gStyle-&gt;SetLabelFont(72);
</programlisting>

<para>Note that when an object is created, its attributes are taken from the current style. For example, you may have created a histogram in a previous session and saved it in a file. Meanwhile, if you have changed the style, the histogram will be drawn with the old attributes. You can force the current style attributes to be set when you read an object from a file by calling <code>ForceStyle</code> before reading the objects from the file.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
gROOT-&gt;ForceStyle();
</programlisting>

<para>When you call <code>gROOT-&gt;ForceStyle()</code> and read an object from a ROOT file, the object’s method <code>UseCurrentStyle</code> is called. The attributes saved with the object are replaced by the current style attributes. You call also call <code>myObject-&gt;UseCurrentStyle()</code>         directly. For example if you have a canvas or pad with your histogram or any other object, you can force these objects to get the attributes of the current style by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
canvas-&gt;UseCurrentStyle();
</programlisting>

<para>The description of the style functions should be clear from the name of the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis> setters or getters. Some functions have an extended description, in particular:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis><code>::SetLabelFont</code></para></listitem>

<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TStyle</code></emphasis><code>::SetTitleOffset</code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TSTyle</code></emphasis><code>::SetOptDate(Int_t optdate)</code> to support several date formats. If <code>optdate</code> is non-null, the current date/time will be printed in the canvas.

<title>3D Viewers</title>
<para>ROOT provides several viewers capable of displaying 3D content:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>the Pad – simple line drawing using <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> and associated projection class <emphasis role="bold"><code>TView</code></emphasis>;</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>GL Viewer – high quality and performance viewer(See “The GL Viewer”);</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>GL-in-pad – combination of basic GL viewer in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>, with no hardware acceleration.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The X3D and GL viewers are created as external windows, associated with a pad, and displaying the same content as it. Only these external viewers are detailed here – for Pad (<emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TView</code></emphasis> classes) you should refer to “Graphical Containers: Canvas and Pad” and the class definitions.</para>
<para>All viewers use a common architecture to publish 3D objects to the viewer - described in “Common 3D Viewer Architecture” below. In most cases, you will <emphasis role="bold">not</emphasis> need to use this, working instead with a package, such as the “The Geometry Package”, which provides comprehensive, high level functionality to create and place objects into complex 3D scenes, and uses the viewer architecture internally to show the result in your chosen viewer.</para>

<sect2>
<title>Invoking a 3D viewer</title>
<para>A 3D viewer can be created in a script by passing the appropriate option to <code>Draw() </code>when attaching the drawn object(s) to a pad. For a fuller explanation of pads, attaching objects with <code>Draw()</code> etc. refer to “Graphical Containers: Canvas and Pad”.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
root[] <emphasis role="bold"><code>myShapes-&gt;Draw(“ogl”);</code></emphasis>
</programlisting>

<para>Valid option strings are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>“<code>ogl</code>” : external GL viewer</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>“<code>x3d</code>”: external X3D viewer</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>“<code>pad</code>”: pad viewer</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If no option is passed to <code>Draw()</code> then the “<code>pad</code>” is used by default. If you already have content in a pad, which you would like to display in one of the external viewers you can select from the canvas View menu / View With, and pick the viewer type.</para>

<title>The GL Viewer</title>
<para>The GL Viewer uses  <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL®</uri> (or compliant libraries such as  <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.mesa3d.org/">Mesa3D</uri>) to generate high quality, high-performance 3D renderings, with sophisticated lighting, materials and rendering styles for 3D scenes. Many users will be able to take advantage of hardware acceleration of the underlying OpenGL commands by their computer’s video card, resulting is considerable performance gains – up to interactive manipulation of 1000’s of complex shapes in real-time.</para>
<para>The GL Viewer is supported on all official ROOT platforms (assuming you have suitable  <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL®</uri> libraries), and is the main 3D viewer, which development effort is concentrated upon. As OpenGL® is a trademark we refer to our viewer built on this technology as the ‘GL Viewer’. The code for it can be found under <code>$ROOTSYS/gl</code>.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Projections Modes (Cameras)</title>
<para>The GL Viewer supports two basic types of camera, which affect how the 3D world is projected onto the 2D render area:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Perspective: Objects are drawn with characteristic ‘foreshortening’ effect, where distant objects appear smaller than near ones. This is useful for obtaining a ‘realworld’ views. The degree of foreshortening is affected by the currentcamera field of view (focal length of its ‘lens’) – see “Adjusting Cameras”.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Orthographic: Distance from camera does not affect object size. These projections are useful for measurement or checking alignments, as the sizes and angles between objects are preserved.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>You can select the active camera from the viewer’s Camera menu on the top menu bar. There are three perspective camera choices:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Perspective (Floor XOZ) Default</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Perspective (Floor YOZ)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Perspective (Floor XOY)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>In each case the perspective camera is constrained to keep the chosen floor plane, defined by a pair of world axes, appearing level at all times – i.e. there is no banking of the ‘horizon’ that you experience when a plane rolls. There are also three orthographic camera choices:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Orthographic (XOY)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Orthographic (XOZ)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Orthographic (ZOY)</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Orthographic projections are generally constrained to look down one of the global axes of the world, with the other two axes lying horizontal/vertical on the viewer window. Therefore, XOY has the X-axis horizontal, the Y-axis vertical. You can always confirm the orientation and constraints of the camera in the world by enabling axis drawing in the “Guides” tab – see sections “Guides” and “Clipping” below. For orthographic camera a ruler-depicting current scene units is also available.</para>
<para>You can also pick the current camera by obtaining a handle to the GL Viewer object behind the interface:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TGLViewer * v = (TGLViewer *)gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D();
</programlisting>

<para>calling the method <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGLViewer</code></emphasis><code>::SetCurrentCamera</code> with one of the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGLViewer</code></emphasis><code>::ECameraType</code> types:</para>

<title>Adjusting Cameras</title>
<para>The interactions with the camera are summarized above. In each case the interaction is listed, along with description and user actions required to achieve it. For all cameras you can reset the original default view, framing the entire scene, by double clicking any mouse button.</para>

<para/>
<para>For the Zoom interaction you can use the following modifiers combinations to adjust the sensitivity:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Shiftx 10</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Ctrlx 0.1</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Shift + Ctrlx 0.01</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The modifiers must be applied after the zoom action has started (right mouse button is down).</para>
<para>Note for orthographic cameras:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>There is no field of view of view/focal length – dollying and zooming producing an identical scaling action.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>There is a fixed eye direction – so the ‘Orbit’ action is disabled.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Note for perspective cameras:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Dollying (moving the camera backwards/forwards) and zooming are often confused, and may appear very similar.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>When you dolly the camera the lens focal length does not change, hence the distortions associated with the projections are unaffected. However the movement can result in objects coming ‘through the front’ of the camera and disappearing.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>When you zoom, the camera does not move – hence clipping of near objects is unaffected. However with extremely small zooms (FOV large/focal length short) noticeable distortions, causing straight lines to become curved, can be seen with objects near the camera – the ‘fisheye’ lens effect.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Generally dollying is more ‘natural’, but you may need to use both to achieve the desired perspective and eye position – particularly when you are working inside or very close to 3D objects.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Configure the camera by calling the methods <code>SetPerspectiveCamera(</code>) or <code>SetOrthographicCamera()</code> of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGLViewer</code></emphasis>:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TGLViewer * v = (TGLViewer *)gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D();

...
v-&gt;SetPerspectiveCamera (camera,fov,dolly,center,hRotate,vRotate);

The current manipulator is attached to it, allowing you direct control over its position, scale and rotation. See “Manipulators” section below for details on using viewer manipulators.</para>
<para>The clip plane is described by the standard plane equation: <emphasis role="bold"><code>ax+by+cz+d=</code></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><code>0</code></emphasis>, where the factors <emphasis role="bold"><code>a</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>b</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>c</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>d</code></emphasis> are entered into the edit boxes, and applied using the ‘Apply’ button.</para>
<para>The clip box is described by its center position, entered in the ‘Center X’, ‘Center Y’ and ‘Center Z’ edit boxes, and its lengths (extents) entered in the ‘Length X’, ‘Length Y’ and ‘Length Z’ edit boxes.</para>
<para>This clipping is achieved using OpenGL clip plane support; as such, there are certain limitations:</para>

<title>Manipulators</title>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Manipulators</emphasis> are GUI ‘widgets’ or controls attached to a 3D object in the viewer, allowing a direct manipulation of the object’s geometry. There are three manipulators for the three basic geometries transformations. In each case, the <emphasis role="italic">manipulator</emphasis> consists of three components, one for each local axis of the object, shown in standard colors: red (X), green (Y) and blue (Z).</para>

<title>Guides</title>
<para>Guides are visual aids drawn into the viewer world. Controls for these are under the “Guides”  tab:</para>
<para>Viewer Controls Pane Guides Tab</para>
<para>Axes show the world (global) frame <emphasis role="italic">coordinate </emphasis>directions: X (red), Y (green) and Z (blue). The negative portion of the <emphasis role="italic">axis</emphasis> line is shown in dark color, the positive in bright. The <emphasis role="italic">axis</emphasis> name and minimum / maximum values are labeled in the same color. There are three options for <emphasis role="italic">axes</emphasis> drawing – selected by radio buttons:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>None – not drawn (default).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Edge – draw axes on the (minimum) edge of the scene extents box.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Origin – drawn axes through the origin.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>For <emphasis role="italic">edge axes</emphasis>, the zero value for each axis is marked on the axis line with a colored sphere. For <emphasis role="italic">origin axes,</emphasis> a single white sphere is shown at the origin.</para>
<para><emphasis role="italic">Edge axes</emphasis> are depth clipped – i.e. are obscured by 3D objects in front of them. <emphasis role="italic">Origin axes</emphasis> (which generally pass through the middle of the 3D scene) are not depth clipped – so always visible.</para>
<para>A single orange sphere of fixed view port (window) size can be shown at any arbitrary position. Enable / disable the drawing with ‘<emphasis role="italic">Show’</emphasis> checkbox. Enter X/Y/Z position in the edit boxes to set position. Initial position is at the center of the scene.</para>

<title>Selecting Scene Shapes</title>
<para>You can select a single shape from your scene by pressing ‘Shift’ key, pointing and left clicking anywhere on the shape in the viewer. Selection is currently shown by drawing the shape-bounding box (not depth clipped) in white (polygon or wire frame render styles) or red (outline render style). Manipulators supported by the shape are drawn in red, green and blue while the non-supported ones are drawn in grey. To deselect a shape, either select another, or shift/click anywhere on the background (empty space) in the viewer. You cannot select Manipulators or Guides (Axes / Reference Marker).</para>
</sect3>

<title>Editing Shapes</title>
<para>When a shape is selected, the viewer’s control pane shows the user interface that allows you to review and adjust the color and geometry properties of the shape.</para>
<para>Note: At present modifications to the shapes are local to the viewer – they are not propagated back to external objects/client that published to the viewer. The changes are preserved only until the viewer is closed. In some cases, this will never be feasible as there is not a one-to-one correspondence between a shape in the viewer and a single external object in which the modification could be stored.</para>

<title>Common 3D Viewer Architecture</title>
<para>The 3D Viewer Architecture provides a common mechanism for viewer clients to publish 3D objects to it. It enables:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Decoupling of producers (geometry packages etc) who model collection of 3D objects from consumers (viewers) which display them.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Producer code free of explicit drawing commands &amp; viewer specific branching.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Support differing viewers and clients capabilities, e.g.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Mix of native (in viewer) shapes and generic client side tessellation.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Local/global frame object description</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Bounding boxes</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Placing copies sharing common geometry (logical/physical shapes).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The architecture consists of:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TVirtualViewer3D</code></emphasis> interface: An abstract handle to the viewer, allowing client to add objects, test preferences etc.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> class hierarchy: Used to describe 3D objects ("shapes") - filled /added by negotiation with viewer via <emphasis role="bold"><code>TVirtualViewer3D</code></emphasis>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>A typical interaction between viewer and client using these, taken from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoPainter</code></emphasis> is:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TVirtualViewer3D * viewer = gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D();
<emphasis role="italic"><code>// Does viewer prefer local frame positions?</code></emphasis>
Bool_t localFrame = viewer-&gt;PreferLocalFrame();
<emphasis role="italic"><code>// Perform first fetch of buffer from the shape and try adding it to the viewer</code></emphasis>
const TBuffer3D &amp;buffer = shape.GetBuffer3D(TBuffer3D::kCore |
TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox |
TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific,
localFrame);
Int_t reqSections = viewer-&gt;AddObject(buffer, &amp;addDaughters);

<emphasis role="italic"><code>// If the viewer requires additional sections fetch from the shape </code></emphasis>
<emphasis role="italic"><code>// (if possible) and add again</code></emphasis>
if (reqSections != TBuffer3D::kNone)
shape.GetBuffer3D(reqSections, localFrame);
</programlisting>

<para>Together these allow clients to publish objects to any one of the 3D viewers free of viewer specific drawing code. They allow our simple x3d viewer, and considerably more sophisticated OpenGL one to both work with both geometry libraries (<code>g3d</code> and <code>geom</code>) efficiently.</para>
<para>In addition to external viewers, created in separate windows, this architecture is also used by internal <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> drawing when it requires 3D projections. Publishing to a viewer consists of the following steps:</para>
<para>   1. Create / obtain viewer handle.</para>
<para>   2. Begin scene on viewer.</para>
<para>   3. Fill mandatory parts of TBuffer3D describing object.</para>
<para>   4. Add to viewer.</para>
<para>   5. Fill optional parts of TBuffer3D as requested by viewer.</para>
<para>        [ .... repeat 3/4/5 as required for other/child objects]</para>
<para>   6. End scene on viewer.</para>
<para>You should attach the top-level node of your external geometry (or the manager) to a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> object using <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>::Draw()</code>, and perform the publishing to the viewer in your object’s <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>::Paint()</code> overloaded method. See “Scene Rebuilds”, and example scripts, for more details.</para>

<sect3>
<title>Creating / Obtaining Viewer Handle</title>
<para>External viewers are bound to a <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> object (this may be removed as a requirement in the future). You can create or obtain the current viewer handle via the method:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TVirtualViewer3D * v = gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D("type");
</programlisting>

<para>Here the “type” string defines the viewer type – currently one of:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>“<code>ogl</code>” : External GL viewer</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>“<code>x3d</code>”: External X3D viewer</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>“<code>pad</code>”: Pad viewer</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If no type is passed (null string), and there is no current viewer, then the type is defaulted to “<code>pad</code>”. If no type is passed and there is a current viewer, then this is returned – hence once a viewer is created it can be obtained elsewhere by:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TVirtualViewer3D * v = gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D();
</programlisting>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Opening / Closing Scenes</title>
<para>Objects must be added to viewer between <code>BeginScene() </code>and         <code>EndScene()</code> calls e.g.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
viewer -&gt;<code> BeginScene</code>();
<emphasis role="italic"><code>// Add objects</code></emphasis>
viewer -&gt;         <code>EndScene</code>();
</programlisting>

<para>These calls enable the viewer to suspend redraws, and perform internal caching/setup. If the object you attach to the pad derives from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TAtt3D</code></emphasis>, then the pad will take responsibility for calling <code>BeginScene()</code> and <code>EndScene()</code> for you. You can always test if the scene is already open for object addition with:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
viewer-&gt;BuildingScene();
</programlisting>

<title>Describing Objects - Filling TBuffer3D</title>
<para>The viewers behind the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TVirtualViewer3D</code></emphasis> interface differ greatly in their capabilities e.g.</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Some support native shape (e.g. spheres/tubes in OpenGL) and can draw these based on an abstract description. Others always require a tessellation description based on <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis>’s <code>kRaw</code>         / <code>kRawSizes</code> points/lines/segments sections.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Some need the 3D object positions in the master (world) frame, others can cope with local frames and a translation matrix to place the object.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Some require bounding boxes for objects – others do not.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>Similarly some viewer clients are only capable of providing positions in master frame, cannot provide bounding boxes etc. Additionally we do not want to incur the cost of expensive tessellation operations if the viewer does not require them. To cope with these variations the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> objects are filled by negotiation with the viewer.</para>

<figure><title>TBuffer3D class hierarchy</title>
<para>
<inlinemediaobject><imageobject><imagedata fileref="pictures/030000E0.png" width="302.9pt" depth="333.3pt"/></imageobject></inlinemediaobject>
</para>
</figure>

<para/>
<para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> classes are conceptually divided into enumerated sections: <code>kCore</code>, <code>kBoundingBox</code>, <code>kRaw</code> – see the class diagram and the file <code>TBuffer3D.h</code> for more details. The <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> methods <code>SectionsValid()</code>, <code>SetSectionsValid()</code>, <code>ClearSectionsValid()</code> are used to test, set, clear these section validity flags e.g.</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific);
<code>…</code>if (buffer.SectionsValid(TBuffer3D:: kShapeSpecific)) {
…
}
</programlisting>

<para>The sections found in the base <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> (<code>kCore/kBoundingBox/kRawSizes/kRaw</code>) are sufficient to describe any tessellated shape in a generic fashion. An additional <code>kShapeSpecific</code> section is added in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> derived classes, allowing a more abstract shape description ("a sphere of inner radius x, outer radius y"). This enables a viewer, which knows how to draw (tessellate) the shape itself to do so, while providing a generic fallback suitable for all viewers. The rules for client negotiation with the viewer are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>If suitable specialized <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> class exists, use it, otherwise use <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Complete the mandatory <code>kCore</code> section.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Complete the <code>kShapeSpecific</code> section if applicable.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Complete the <code>kBoundingBox</code> if you can.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Pass this buffer to the viewer using one of the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject()</code> methods.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If the viewer requires more sections to be completed (<code>kRaw/kRawSizes</code>) <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject()</code> will return flags indicating which ones, otherwise it returns <code>kNone</code>. If requested, you must fill the buffer, mark these sections valid, and call <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject</code> again, to complete adding the object. For example, in out <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeo</code></emphasis> geometry package, in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoPainter</code></emphasis><code>::PaintShape</code>, we perform the negotiation with viewer:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
TVirtualViewer3D * viewer = gPad-&gt;GetViewer3D();
if (shape.IsA() != TGeoCompositeShape::Class()) {
<emphasis role="italic"><code>   // Does viewer prefer local frame positions?</code></emphasis>
Bool_t localFrame = viewer-&gt;PreferLocalFrame();
<emphasis role="italic"><code>   // Perform first fetch of buffer from the shape and adding it to the viewer</code></emphasis>
const TBuffer3D &amp;buffer = shape.GetBuffer3D(TBuffer3D::kCore |
TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox |
TBuffer3D::kShapeSpecific
,localFrame);
Int_t reqSections = viewer-&gt;AddObject(buffer, &amp;addDaughters);
<emphasis role="italic"><code>   // If the viewer requires additional sections fetch from the shape </code></emphasis>
<emphasis role="italic"><code>// (if possible) and add again</code></emphasis>
if (reqSections != TBuffer3D::kNone) {
shape.GetBuffer3D(reqSections, localFrame);
viewer-&gt;AddObject(buffer, &amp;addDaughters);
}
}
</programlisting>

<para>The buffer is supplied/filled by the appropriate <emphasis role="bold"><code>TShape</code></emphasis><code>::GetBuffer3D()</code> and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TShape</code></emphasis><code>::FillBuffer3D</code> overloads e.g. for a sphere in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoSphere</code></emphasis>.</para>

return buffer;

Splitting avoids having to do the expensive tessellation on the first pass.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Shape Specific TBuffer3D Derived Classes</title>
<para>Currently we provide the following shape specific classes, which the GL Viewer can take advantage of (see <code>TBuffer3D.h</code> and <code>TBuffer3DTypes.h</code>)</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3DSphere</code></emphasis> - solid, hollow and cut spheres (GL Viewer only supports solid spheres at present – cut / hollow ones will be requested as tessellated objects by client.)</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3DTube</code></emphasis> – basic tube with inner/outer radius and length.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3DTubeSeg</code></emphasis> - angle tube segment.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3DCutTube</code></emphasis> - angle tube segment with plane cut ends.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>See the above example from <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoSphere</code></emphasis><code>::GetBuffer3D</code> and also equivalent functions in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoTube</code></emphasis>, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoTubeSeg</code></emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoCtub</code></emphasis>. Anyone is free to add new <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> classes, but it should be clear that one or more viewers will require updating to be able to take advantage of them. Hence we only provide classes which existing viewers can benefit from. The number of native shapes in GL Viewer will be expanded in the future.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Master / Local Reference Frames</title>
<para>The Core section of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> contains two members relating to reference frames:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>fLocalFrame</code>: indicates if any positions in the buffer (bounding box and tessellation vertexes) are in local or master (world frame).</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><code>fLocalMaster</code>: is a standard 4x4 translation matrix (OpenGL column major ordering) for placing the object into the 3D master frame.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>If <code>fLocalFrame</code> is false, <code>fLocalMaster</code> should contain an identity matrix. This is set by default, and can be reset using the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::SetLocalMasterIdentity()</code> method.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Bounding Boxes</title>
<para>You are not obliged to complete the <code>kBoundingBox</code> section, as any viewer requiring one internally (GL Viewer) will build it if you do not provide. However to do this the viewer will force you to provide the (expensive) raw tessellation, and the resulting box will be axis aligned with the overall scene, which is non-ideal for rotated shapes. As we need to support orientated (rotated) bounding boxes, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> requires the 6 vertices of the box. We also provide a convenience function, <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer</code></emphasis><code>::SetAABoundingBox()</code>, for simpler case of setting an axis aligned bounding box. The bounding box should be filled in same frame (local / master) as the rest of the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis>, and inaccordance with <code>fLocalFrame</code> flag.</para>
<para>A typical example from TGeoBBox::FillBuffer3D:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
if (reqSections &amp; TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox) {
Double_t halfLengths[3] = { fDX, fDY, fDZ };
buffer.SetAABoundingBox(fOrigin, halfLengths);
if (!buffer.fLocalFrame) {
TransformPoints(buffer.fBBVertex[0], 8);
}
buffer.SetSectionsValid(TBuffer3D::kBoundingBox);
}
</programlisting>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Logical and Physical Objects</title>
<para>Some viewers can support two types of object placement:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Add object as a single independent entity in the world reference frame – e.g. a sphere, radius <code>r</code>, at <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>Repeated placement (copying) in world frame of this locally unique piece of geometry (described in local reference frame) e.g. define a sphere <code>S</code> (radius <code>r</code>), place copy at <code>x1</code>, <code>y1</code>, <code>z1</code>, another copy at <code>x2</code>, <code>y2</code>, <code>z2</code> etc.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>The second case is very typical in geometry packages, e.g. ROOT’s <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeo</code></emphasis> package, GEANT4 etc, where we have very large number repeated placements of relatively few unique “shapes”.</para>
<para>Some viewers (GL Viewer only at present) are able to take advantage of this by identifying unique logical shapes from the <code>fID</code> logical ID member of <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis>. If repeated addition of the same <code>fID</code> is found, the shape is cached already - and the costly tessellation does not need to be sent again. The viewer can also perform internal GL specific caching (display lists) with considerable performance gains in these cases. For this to work correctly the logical object in must be described in <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> in the local reference frame, complete with the local<code>/</code>master translation. In some cases you will not have a real object you can reasonably set <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::fID</code> to, or the object is recycled or temporary. To suppress internal caching in the GL Viewer in these cases, set <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::fID</code> to 0 (null).</para>
<para>The viewer indicates it can support local frame objects through the <emphasis role="bold"><code>TVirtualViewer</code></emphasis><emphasis role="bold"><code>3D</code></emphasis> interface method: <code>PreferLocalFrame()</code>. If this returns <code>kTRUE</code> you can make repeated calls to <code>AddObject()</code>, with <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis> containing the same <code>fID</code>, and different <code>fLocalMaster</code> placements.</para>
<para>For viewers supporting logical/physical objects, the TBuffer3D content refers to the properties of the logical object, with the exception of:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><code>fLocalMaster</code> transform</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>    <code>fColor </code></para></listitem>
<listitem><para>    <code>fTransparency</code></para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para> attributes, which can be varied for <emphasis role="bold">each</emphasis> physical object.</para>
<para>As <emphasis role="bold">a minimum requirement</emphasis> all clients must be capable of filling the raw tessellation of the object buffer, in the master reference frame. Conversely viewers must always be capable of displaying the object described by this buffer. If either does not meet this requirement the object may not be displayed.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Scene Rebuilds</title>
<para><emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject</code> is not an explicit command to the viewer - it may for various reasons decide to ignore it:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>It already has the object internally cached.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The object falls outside some 'interest' limits of the viewer camera.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>The object is too small to be worth drawing.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>In all these cases <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject()</code> returns kNone, as it does for successful addition, indicating it does not require further information about this object. Hence you should not try to make any assumptions about what the viewer did with the object. The viewer may decide to force the client to rebuild (republish) the scene, obtaining a different collection of objects, if the internal viewer state changes .e.g. significant camera move. It does this presently by forcing a repaint on the attached <emphasis role="bold"><code>TPad</code></emphasis> object – hence you should attach you master geometry object to the pad (via <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject</code></emphasis><code>::Draw()</code>), and perform the publishing to the viewer in response to <emphasis role="bold"><code>TObject::Paint()</code></emphasis>.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Physical IDs</title>
<para>TVirtualViewer3D provides for two methods of object addition:</para>

<programlisting language="c++">
virtual Int_t AddObject(const TBuffer3D &amp;buffer, Bool_t * addChildren = 0)
virtual Int_t AddObject(UInt_t physicalID, const TBuffer3D &amp; buffer,
Bool_t *addChildren = 0)
</programlisting>

<para>If you use the first (simple) case a viewer using logical/physical pairs will generate sequential IDs for each physical object internally. Scene rebuilds will require destruction and recreation of all physical objects. For the second you can specify an identifier from the client side, which must be unique and stable – i.e. the IDs of a published object is consistent, regardless of changes in termination of contained child geometry branches. In this case the viewer can safely cache the physical objects across scene rebuilds, discarding those no longer of interest.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Child Objects</title>
<para>In many geometries there is a rigid containment hierarchy, and so if the viewer is not interested in a certain object due to limits/size then it will also not be interest in any of the contained branch of siblings. Both <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject()</code> methods have an <code>addChildren</code> return parameter. The viewer will complete this (if passed) indicating if children of the object just sent are worth sending.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Recycling TBuffer3D</title>
<para>Once add <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis><code>::AddObject()</code> has been called, the contents are copied to the viewer’s internal data structures. You are free to destroy this <emphasis role="bold"><code>TBuffer3D</code></emphasis>, or recycle it for the next object if suitable.</para>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Examples</title>
<para>For an example of a simple geometry, working in master reference frame examine the code under <code>$ROOTSYS/g3d</code>. For a more complex example, which works in both master and local frames, and uses logical<code>/</code>physical division of shape geometry and placement, examine the code under <code>$ROOTSYS/geom</code> – in particular <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoShape</code></emphasis> hierarchy, and the painter object <emphasis role="bold"><code>TGeoPainter</code></emphasis> (under geopainter) where the negotiation with the viewer is performed.</para>
