You can execute the scripts in $ROOTSYS/tutorials (or sub-directories)
by setting your current directory in the script directory or from any
user directory with write access.
Several tutorials create new files. If you have write access to
the tutorials directory, the new files will be created in the tutorials
directory, otherwise they will be created in the user directory.

You can start by executing the standard ROOT demos with a session like
  root > .x demos.C
or
  root > .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/demos.C

You can execute the standard ROOT graphics benchmark with
  root > .x benchmarks.C
or
  root > .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/benchmarks.C

The $ROOTSYS/tutorials directory include several sub-directories
