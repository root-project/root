   // To have a better and dynamic view of any of these pads,
   // you can click with the middle button of your mouse to select it.
   // Then select "View with x3d" in the VIEW menu of the Canvas.
   // Once in x3d, you are in wireframe mode by default.
   // You can switch to:
   //   - Hidden Line mode by typing E
   //   - Solid mode by typing R
   //   - Wireframe mode by typing W
   //   - Stereo mode by clicking S (and you need special glasses)
   //   - To leave x3d type Q
