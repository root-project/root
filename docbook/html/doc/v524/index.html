<h3>Html</h3>
<p>THtml is now using the leyout of the new ROOT web site. There is a number of other improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sources now show line numbers. Each line number is a link and an anchor, i.e. it can be jumped to.</li>
<li>The line number can be copy&amp;pasted: mark the line number from the right and drag your mouse to the left until teh line number and a space next to it are marked. When you paste this you will get the file and line number in the GDB-format (<tt>MyFile.cxx:123</tt>), e.g. to set breakpoints.</li>
<li>THtml now uses short class names, e.g. <tt>map&lt;A,B,less&lt;A&gt;,allocator&lt;pair&lt;A,B&gt; &gt; &gt;</tt> now simply becomes <tt>map&lt;A,B&gt;</tt>.</li>
</ul>
