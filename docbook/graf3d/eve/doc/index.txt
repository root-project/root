    Eve is a ROOT module based on experiment-independant part of the
    ALICE event display developed in cooperation between ALICE offline
    project and ROOT during the last two years. It has been used in
    ALICE for more than a year to perform high-level event
    visualization, debugging of simulation and reconstruction code as
    well as for raw-data visualization.

    Eve is built on top of ROOT's GUI, GL and GED infrastructure and
    delivers the following main features:

    <ul>

      <li> Base-classes for representation of visual objects that can
	be presented in list-tree views, object-editors and rendered
	via OpenGL (<tt>TEveElement</tt> and sub-classes).

      <li> Application manager class <tt>TEveManager</tt> for top-level
	management of elements, GUI components, geometries and events;

      <li> Classes for presentation of full TGeo geometries
	(<tt>TEveGeoNode</tt> and <tt>TEveGeoTopNode</tt>) as well as of
	simplifed geometries via extraction of shape-data
	(<tt>TEveGeoShape</tt>).

	<p><img alt="CMS geometry." src="gif/eve-cmsgeo.png">
	
      <li> Classes for presentation of trajectories or tracks
	(<tt>TEveTrack</tt>, <tt>TEveTrackPropagator</tt>) and hits or
	clusters (<tt>TEvePointSet</tt>, <tt>TEvePointSetArray</tt>).

	<p><img alt="A simulated ALICE pp@14TeV event in 3D." src="gif/eve-alice3d.png">

      <li> Base-classes for presentation of raw-data or digits
	(<tt>TEveDigitSet</tt>, <tt>TEveQuadSet</tt> and
	<tt>TEveBoxSet</tt>). A collection of objects can be assigned
	common signal-to-color mapping (<tt>TEveRGBAPelette</tt>) and
	surrounding frame (<tt>TEveFrameBox</tt>).

	<p><img alt="Hexagonal and rectangular digits." src="gif/eve-quadset.png">

      <li> Base-classes for 2D projections with dynamically controllable
	fish-eye magnification of the vertex region
	(<tt>TEveProjectionManager</tt> and
	<tt>TEveProjection</tt>). Tracks, points and geometries can be
	projected automatically. R-phi and Rho-z projections are
	currently supported.

      <li> <tt>TriangleSet</tt> class for presentation of generic
	triangle meshes.
