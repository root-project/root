<h3>Core</h3>
<ul>
<li>The following architectures have been obsoleted: linuxkcc, alphakcc,
linuxia64sgi, linuxdeb2ppc, solariskcc, sgikcc and linuxpgcc.</li>
<li>All of ROOT (not just Core) has been checked by a very nice static code analyzer <b>coverity</b>, see: <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">http://www.coverity.com/</a>. 
Many of the reports have been fixed. We expect that this further increases the stability of ROOT.</li>
<li>Add support for 'Dump' and 'Browse' of 'emulated' object.</li>
<li>TBits equality operator nows return true if the 2 operands have different
length and all the bits in the longer TBits that are passed the length
of the shorter TBits are zero (i.e. the default value of each
bits is zero).</li>
<li>Properly handle scripts with line longer than 1024 characters.</li>
<li>Repair the handling of ACLiC options on the command line (for example a.C+g).</li>
<li>In TClass::BuildEmulatedRealData properly handle the case of TNamed member that are not base class.</li>
<li>On the command line:
    <ul>
    <li>Fix the tab-completion of filenames in the sub-directories.</li>
    <li>Prevent the unadvertent replacement of an arrow with a dot when the left side is actually a pointer</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>More user friendly stacktrace in case of a crash, with hints where
the problem might be. On Linux and MacOS X these stacktraces are generated
by the script $ROOTSYS/etc/gdb-backtrace.sh. Using the Root.StackTraceMessage
resource one can customize the message printed by the script. The entire
script can be replaced using the Root.StacktraceScript resource.</li>
<li>Numerous minor bug fixes...</li>
</ul>
<h4>New module  <tt>editline</tt> </h4>
<p>The new module <tt>editline</tt> enhances the prompt, giving type and syntax feedback using e.g. colors.
Class names are highlighted blue when typed, indicating that it is known to ROOT.  
Matching parenthesis pairs are highlighted green when typed, or when the cursor is moved to a bracket. This works for () {} and [] brackets.
Any mismatched brackets (those without a matching partner) will be highlighted red when typed or when the cursor is moved to the bracket.
Tab completion output is colored magenta to differentiate between tab completion output and user input.</p>
<p>All of the colors are configurable in the <tt>.rootrc</tt> file.
They can be specified as #rgb or #rrggbb or color names:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan or white.
They can be followed by an optional <tt>bold</tt> (alias <tt>light</tt>) or <tt>underlined</tt>.
<tt>Rint.ReverseColor</tt> allows to quickly toggle between the default "light on dark" (<tt>yes</tt>) instead of "dark on light" (<tt>no</tt>), depending on the terminal background.</p>
<p>An example configuration would be:</p>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
Rint.TypeColor:           blue
Rint.BracketColor:        bold green
Rint.BadBracketColor:     underlined red
Rint.TabColor:            magenta
Rint.PromptColor:         black
Rint.ReverseColor:        no
</pre>
<p>The enhanced prompt is available on all platforms with [n]curses, including Linux, Solaris and MacOS; the bold and underline options are available also for black and white terminals. You can <tt>export</tt> (or <tt>setenv</tt>) <tt>TERM=xterm-256color</tt> for nicer colors.</p>
<p>With editline comes also an improved terminal input handler.
It supports e.g. ^O (Ctrl-o) to replay the history: suppose you have entered</p>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
...
<span style="color:gray">root [3] </span>i = func()
<span style="color:gray">root [4] </span>i += 12
<span style="color:gray">root [5] </span>printf("i is %d\n", i)
</pre>
<p>You now want to re-run these three lines.
As always, you press the up cursor three times to see</p>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
<span style="color:gray">root [6] </span>i = func()
</pre>
<p>and now press ^O (Ctrl-o) to run the line, and prepare the next line:</p>
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
<span style="color:gray">root [6] </span>i = func()^O
<span style="color:gray">root [7] </span>i += 12^O
<span style="color:gray">root [8] </span>printf("i is %d\n", i)^O
<span style="color:gray">root [9] </span>
</pre>
<p>allowing you to re-run that part of the history without having to press the up-arrow again and again.</p>
<p>Currently, <tt>editline</tt> is disabled on Windows.</p>
