System requirements:
--------------------

  TMVA has been tested to run on Linux, MAC/OSX and Windows platforms.

  Running TMVA requires the availability of ROOT shared libraries with ROOT_VERSION >= 5.14
  (type "root-config --version" to see the version installed)

========================================================================================

Getting Started: 
----------------

  How to compile the code:
  ------------------------
  /home> cd TMVA
  /home/TMVA> make                   # compile and build the library lib/libTMVA.1.so

  How to run the code as ROOT macro: # training/testing of an academic example
  ----------------------------------
  /home/TMVA> cd test
  /home/TMVA/test> source setup.sh   # setup script must be exectuted before running macros (use setup.csh for c-shell)

  --- For classification:
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVAClassification.C                       # run all standard classifiers (takes a while)
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVAClassification.C\(\"LD,Likelihood\"\)  # run LD and Likelihood classifiers

  --- For regression:
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVARegression.C                           # run all regression algorithms n(takes a while)
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVARegression.C\(\"LD,KNN\"\)             # run LD and k-NN regression algorithms

  --> at the end of the jobs, a GUI will pop up: try to click through all the buttons;
      some of the lower buttons are method-specific, and will only work when the
      corresponding classifiers/regression algorithms have been trained/tested before
      (unless they are greyed out)

  How to run the code as an executable: 
  -------------------------------------
  /home/TMVA/test> make
  /home/TMVA/test> ./TMVAClassification                              # run all standard classifiers 
  /home/TMVA/test> ./TMVAClassification LD Likelihood                # run LD and Likelihood classifiers 

  ... and similarly for regression

  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVAGui.C   # start the GUI

  How to run the code as an python script using PyROOT: 
  -------------------------------------
  /home/TMVA/test> make
  /home/TMVA/test> python ./TMVAClassification.py --method LD,Likelihood

  How to apply the TMVA methods:
  -------------------------------------
  /home/TMVA> cd test

  --- For classification:
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVAClassificationApplication.C                
  /home/TMVA/test> root -l TMVAClassificationApplication.C\(\"LD,Likelihood\"\) 

  ... and similar for regression.
  ... and similar for executables.

  The directory structure:
  ------------------------
  inc/          : the TMVA class headers
  src/          : the TMVA class source
  lib/          : here you'll find the TMVA library (libTMVA.1.so) after compilation
  test/         : example code for analysis macros and executables, the GUI and analysis scripts.

Executive summary:
------------------

The Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) provides a machine learning environment 
for the processing and parallel evaluation of multivariate classification and regression
algorithms. TMVA is integrated into the data analysis framework ROOT. It is specifically 
designed to the needs of high-energy physics (HEP) applications, but should not be 
restricted to these. The package includes:

    * Rectangular cut optimisation
    * Projective likelihood estimation (PDE approach)
    * Multi-dimensional likelihood estimation (PDE - range-search, PDE-foam, and k-NN)
    * Linear discriminant analysers (H-Matrix, Fisher Discriminant, and Linear Discr. (same as Fisher))
    * Function discriminant analysis (FDA)
    * Artificial neural networks (three different Multilayer Perceptron implementations)
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    * Boosted/Bagged decision trees
    * Predictive learning via rule ensembles (RuleFit) 

TMVA consists of object-oriented implementations in C++ for each of these discrimination 
techniques and provides training, testing and performance evaluation algorithms and 
visualization scripts. The classifier/regression training and testing is performed with 
the use of user-supplied data sets in form of ROOT trees or text files, where each event 
can have an individual weight. The true event classification/target value in these data 
sets must be known. Preselection requirements and transformations can be applied on this 
data. TMVA supports the use of variable combinations and formulas.

TMVA works in transparent factory mode to guarantee an unbiased performance comparison 
between the algorithms: all algorithms see the same training and test data, and are 
evaluated following the same prescriptions within the same execution job. A Factory 
class organises the interaction between the user and the TMVA analysis steps. It performs 
preanalysis and preprocessing of the training data to assess basic properties of the 
discriminating variables used as input to the algorithms. The linear correlation 
coefficients of the input variables are calculated and displayed, and a preliminary 
ranking is derived (which is later superseded by method-specific variable rankings). 
The variables can be linearly transformed (individually for each algorithm) into a 
non-correlated variable space or projected upon their principle components. To compare 
the signal-efficiency and background-rejection performance of the algorithms, the 
analysis job prints tabulated results for some benchmark values, besides other criteria 
such as a measure of the separation and the maximum signal significance. Smooth 
efficiency versus background rejection curves are stored in a ROOT output file, 
together with other graphical evaluation information. These results can be displayed 
using ROOT macros, which are conveniently executed via a graphical user interface that 
comes with the TMVA distribution.

The TMVA training job runs alternatively as a ROOT script, as a standalone executable, 
where libTMVA.so is linked as a shared library, or as a python script via the PyROOT 
interface. Each MVA method trained in one of these applications writes its configuration 
and training results in result (``weight'') files, which consists of one text and one 
ROOT file.

A light-weight Reader class is provided, which reads and interprets the weight files 
(interfaced by the corresponding MVA method), and which can be included in any C++ 
executable, ROOT macro or python analysis job.

For standalone use of the trained MVA methods, TMVA also generates lightweight C++ 
response classes (not available for all MVA methods), which contain the encoded 
information from the weight files so that these are not required anymore. These classes 
do not depend on TMVA or ROOT, neither on any other external library.

We have put emphasis on the clarity and functionality of the Factory and Reader 
interfaces to the user applications. All MVA methods run with reasonable default 
configurations, so that for standard applications that do not require particular 
tuning, the user script for a full TMVA analysis will hardly exceed a few lines 
of code. For individual optimisation the user can (and should) customize the 
classifiers via configuration strings.

Please report any problems and/or suggestions for improvements to the authors.
