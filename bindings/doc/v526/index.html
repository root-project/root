<h3>PyROOT</h3>

<p>
Fixes were made to "member-style" access on TTrees, to handle several more
common cases, such as where names do not match, and sub-branching.
Likewise, TPySelector was improved to handle new use cases where it needed
a function default constructor, and where the user wants to change the
associated TTree.

It is now possible to use buffers, rather than strings, for char* function
arguments.
