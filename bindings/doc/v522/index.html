<h3>MATLAB</h3>
A MATLAB/ROOT interface has been developped by Johannes Kissel.
It is a data interface for reading and writing ROOT files from within MATLAB
just as you do with MATLAB files. For more information, see <a href="http://root.cern.ch/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=7376"> this announcement at the <b>ROOT Forum</b></a>.

<h3>PyROOT</h3>

<p>
Support for python 2.6 has been added. Older versions will compile fine, but will
have problems when using the buffer interface for C arrays.
</p>

<p>
For user convenience, code was added to load a custom rootlogon.py/.C, if available.
This code is loaded on first use of the ROOT module, and the python rootlogon.py is
loaded as a module.
</p>

<p>
The language was improved by added a _creates property to all MethodProxy methods.
By setting this value to True, objects returned by such methods will be owned (and
reference counted) by the python interpreter.
By default, the Clone() and DrawClone() methods will have _create equal to True.
