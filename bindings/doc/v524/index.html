<h3>PyROOT</h3>

<p>
Null-pointers now carry type, rather than being the None object, to make sure
that correct overloads are selected.
Memory policy is settable on individual functions, rather than only globally,
through the _mempolicy data member that functions carry.
</p>

<p>
In order to support PyPy analysis of PyROOT code, getter/setter methods have
been added to the proxies.
The pydoc tool already benefits from this, since PyROOT objects are now a bit
easier to inspect by such standard tools
</p>

<p>
By short-circuiting some paths during class proxy creation, loading of the
libPyROOT module is now faster.
