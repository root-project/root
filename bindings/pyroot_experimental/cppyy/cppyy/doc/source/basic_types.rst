Basic Types
===========

C++ has a far richer set of builtin types than Python.
Most Python code can remain relatively agnostic to that, and ``cppyy``
provides automatic conversions as appropriate.
On the other hand, Python builtin types such as lists and maps are far
richer than any builtin types in C++.
These are mapped to their Standard Template Library equivalents instead.

The C++ code used for the examples below can be found
:doc:`here <cppyy_features_header>`, and it is assumed that that code is
loaded at the start of any session.
Download it, save it under the name ``features.h``, and load it:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> import cppyy
    >>> cppyy.include('features.h')
    >>>


`Builtins`
""""""""""

The selection of builtin data types varies greatly between Python and C++.
Where possible, builtin data types map onto the expected equivalent Python
types, with the caveats that there may be size differences, different
precision or rounding, etc.
For example, a C++ ``float`` is returned as a Python ``float``, which is in
fact a C++ ``double``.
If sizes allow, conversions are automatic.
For example, a C++ ``unsigned int`` becomes a Python2 ``long`` or Python3
``int``, but unsigned-ness is still honored:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> cppyy.gbl.gUint
    0L
    >>> type(cppyy.gbl.gUint)
    <type 'long'>
    >>> cppyy.gbl.gUint = -1
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ValueError: cannot convert negative integer to unsigned
    >>>

Some types are builtin in Python, but (STL) classes in C++.
Examples are ``str`` vs. ``std::string`` and ``complex`` vs. ``std::complex``.
These classes have been pythonized to behave the same wherever possible.
For example, string comparison work directly, and ``std::complex`` has
``real`` and ``imag`` properties:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> c = cppyy.gbl.std.complex['double'](1, 2)
    >>> c
    (1+2j)
    >>> c.real, c.imag
    (1.0, 2.0)
    >>> s = cppyy.gbl.std.string("aap")
    >>> type(s)
    <class cppyy.gbl.std.string at 0x7fa75edbf8a0>
    >>> s == "aap"
    True
    >>> 

To pass an argument through a C++ ``char`` (signed or unsigned) use a Python
string of size 1.
In many cases, the explicit C types from module ``ctypes`` can also be used,
but that module does not have a public API (for type conversion or otherwise),
so support is somewhat limited.

There are automatic conversions between C++'s ``std::vector`` and Python's
``list`` and ``tuple``, where possible, as they are often used in a similar
manner.
These datatypes have completely different memory layouts, however, and the
``std::vector`` requires that all elements are of the same type and laid
out consecutively in memory.
Conversion thus requires type checks, memory allocation, and copies.
This can be rather expensive.


`Arrays`
""""""""

Builtin arrays are supported through arrays from module ``array`` (or any
other builtin-type array that implements the Python buffer interface, such
as numpy arrays) and a low-level view type from ``cppyy`` for returns and
variable access (that implements the buffer interface as well).
Out-of-bounds checking is limited to those cases where the size is known at
compile time.
Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from cppyy.gbl import Concrete
    >>> from array import array
    >>> c = Concrete()
    >>> c.array_method(array('d', [1., 2., 3., 4.]), 4)
    1 2 3 4
    >>> c.m_data[4] # static size is 4, so out of bounds
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: buffer index out of range
    >>>

Arrays of arrays are supported through the C++ low-level view objects.
This only works well if sizes are known at compile time or can be inferred.
If sizes are not known, the size is set to a large integer (depending on the
array element size) to allow access.
It is then up to the developer not to access the array out-of-bounds.
There is limited support for arrays of instances, but those should be avoided
in C++ anyway:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> cppyy.cppdef('std::string str_array[3][2] = {{"aa", "bb"}, {"cc", "dd"}, {"ee", "ff"}};')
    True
    >>> type(cppyy.gbl.str_array[0][1])
    <class cppyy.gbl.std.string at 0x7fd650ccb650>
    >>> cppyy.gbl.str_array[0][1]
    'bb'
    >>> cppyy.gbl.str_array[4][0]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    IndexError: tuple index out of range
    >>>


`Pointers`
""""""""""

When the C++ code takes a pointer or reference type to a specific builtin
type (such as an ``unsigned int`` for example), then types need to match
exactly.
``cppyy`` supports the types provided by the standard modules ``ctypes`` and
``array`` for those cases.
Example of using a reference to builtin:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from ctypes import c_uint
    >>> u = c_uint(0)
    >>> c.uint_ref_assign(u, 42)
    >>> u.value
    42
    >>>

For objects, an object, a pointer to an object, and a smart pointer to an
object are represented the same way, with the necessary (de)referencing
applied automatically.
Pointer variables are also bound by reference, so that updates on either the
C++ or Python side are reflected on the other side as well.


`Enums`
"""""""

Named, anonymous, and class enums are supported.
The Python-underlying type of an enum is implementation dependent and may even
be different for different enums on the same compiler.
Typically, however, the types are ``int`` or ``unsigned int``, which
translates to Python's ``int`` or ``long`` on Python2 or class ``int`` on
Python3.
Separate from the underlying, all enums have their own Python type to allow
them to be used in template instantiations:

  .. code-block:: python

    >>> from cppyy.gbl import kBanana   # classic enum, globally available
    >>> print(kBanana)
    29
    >>> cppyy.gbl.EFruit
    <class '__main__.EFruit'>
    >>> print(cppyy.gbl.EFruit.kApple)
    78
    >>> cppyy.gbl.E1                    # C++11 class enum, scoped
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    AttributeError: <namespace cppyy.gbl at 0x7ff2766a4af0> has no attribute 'E1'.
    >>> cppyy.gbl.NamedClassEnum.E1
    42
    >>>
