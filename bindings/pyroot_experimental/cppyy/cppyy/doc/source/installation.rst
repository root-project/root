Installation
============

``cppyy`` requires a (modern) C++ compiler.
When installing through `conda-forge`_, ``conda`` will install the compiler
for you, to match the other conda-forge packages.
When using ``pip`` and the wheels from `PyPI`_, you minimally need gcc5,
clang5, or MSVC'17.
When installing from source, the only requirement is full support for C++11
(e.g. minimum gcc 4.8.1 on GNU/Linux), but older compilers than the ones
listed for the wheels have not been tested.

With CPython on Linux or Mac, probably by far the easiest way to install
``cppyy``, is through conda-forge on `Anaconda`_ (or `miniconda`_).
A Windows recipe for ``conda`` is not available yet, but is forthcoming, so
use ``pip`` for that platform for now (see below).
PyPI always has the authoratative releases (conda-forge pulls the sources
from there), so conda-forge may sometimes lag PyPI.
If you absolutely need the latest release, use PyPI or consider
:ref:`building from source <building_from_source>`.

To install using ``conda``, create and/or activate your (new) work environment
and install from the conda-forge channel::

  $ conda create -n WORK
  $ conda activate WORK
  (WORK) $ conda install -c conda-forge cppyy
  (WORK) [current compiler] $

To install with ``pip`` through `PyPI`_, it is recommend to use
`virtualenv`_ (or module `venv`_ for modern pythons).
The use of virtualenv prevents pollution of any system directories and allows
you to wipe out the full installation simply by removing the virtualenv
created directory ("WORK" in this example)::

  $ virtualenv WORK
  $ source WORK/bin/activate
  (WORK) $ python -m pip install cppyy
  (WORK) $

If you use the ``--user`` option to ``pip`` and use ``pip`` directly on the
command line, instead of through ``python``, make sure that the ``PATH``
envar points to the bin directory that will contain the installed entry
points during the installation, as the build process needs them.
You may also need to install ``wheel`` first, if you have an older version of
``pip`` and/or do not use virtualenv (which installs wheel by default).
Example::

 $ python -m pip install wheel --user
 $ PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH python -m pip install cppyy --user


Pre-compiled wheels on PyPI
---------------------------

Wheels for the backend (``cppyy-cling``) are available on PyPI for GNU/Linux,
MacOS-X, and MS Windows (both 32b and 64b).

The Linux wheels are built on manylinux, but with gcc 5.5, not the 4.8.2 that
ships with manylinux1, since ``cppyy`` exposes C++ APIs and g++ introduced
ABI incompatibilities starting with its 5 series forward.
Using 4.8.2 would have meant that any software using ``cppyy`` would have to
be (re)compiled for the older gcc ABI, which the odds don't favor.
Note that building cppyy fully with 4.8.2 (and requiring the old ABI across
the board) does work.

The wheels for MS Windows were build with MSVC Community Edition 2017.

There are no wheels for the ``CPyCppyy`` and ``cppyy`` packages, to allow
the C++ standard chosen to match the local compiler.


Combining conda and pip
-----------------------

Although installing ``cppyy`` through `conda-forge`_ is recommended, it is
possible to build/install with ``pip`` under Anaconda/miniconda.

Typical Python extensions only expose a C interface for use through the
Python C-API, requiring only calling conventions (and the Python C-API
version, of course) to match to be binary compatible.
Here, ``cppyy`` differs because it exposes C++ APIs, among others as part of
its bootstrap, meaning that it needs a C++ run-time that is ABI compatible
with the C++ compiler that was used during build-time.

There is a set of modern compilers available through conda-forge, but it is
only intended to be used through ``conda-build``.
In particular, it does not set up the corresponding run-time (it does install
it, for use through rpath when building).
For example, it adds the conda compilers to ``PATH`` but not their libraries
to ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` (this for Mac and Linux; MS Windows uses ``PATH`` for
both executables and libraries).
The upshot is that you get the cond compilers and your system libraries mixed
in the same environment, unless you set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` yourself,
e.g. by adding ``$CONDA_PREFIX/lib``.
That is, however, not recommended per the conda documentation.
Furthermore, the compilers pulled in from conda-forge are not their vanilla
distributions: header files have been modified.
This can lead to parsing problems if your system C library does not support
C11, for example.

Nevertheless, with the above caveats, if your system C/C++ run-times are new
enough, the following can be made to work::

 $ conda create -n WORK
 $ conda activate WORK
 (WORK) $ conda install python
 (WORK) $ conda install -c conda-forge compilers
 (WORK) [current compiler] $ python -m pip install cppyy


Switching C++ standard with pip
-------------------------------

The C++17 standard is the default for Mac and Linux (both PyPI and
conda-forge); but it is C++14 for MS Windows (compiler limitation).
When installing from PyPI using ``pip``, you can control the standard
selection by setting the ``STDCXX`` envar to '17', '14', or '11' (for Linux,
the backend does not need to be recompiled).
Note that the build will lower your choice if the compiler used does not
support a newer standard.


Installing from source
----------------------
.. _installation_from_source:

The easiest way to install completely from source is again to use ``pip`` and
simply tell it to use the source distribution.
Build-time only dependencies are ``cmake`` (for general build), ``python``
(obviously, but also for LLVM), and a modern C++ compiler (one that supports
at least C++11).
Besides ``STDCXX`` to control the C++ standard version, you can use ``MAKE``
to change the ``make`` command and ``MAKE_NPROCS`` to control the maximum
number of parallel jobs.
For example (using ``--verbose`` to see progress)::

 $ STDCXX=17 MAKE_NPROCS=32 pip install --verbose cppyy --no-binary=cppyy-cling

The wheel of ``cppyy-cling`` is reused by pip for all versions of CPython and
PyPy, thus the long compilation is needed only once for all different
versions of Python on the same machine.

On MS Windows, some temporary path names may be too long, causing the build to
fail.
To resolve this issue, set the ``TMP`` and ``TEMP`` envars to something short,
before building.
For example::

 > set TMP=C:\TMP
 > set TEMP=C:\TMP

Compilation of the backend, which contains a customized version of
Clang/LLVM, can take a long time, so by default the setup script will use all
cores (x2 if hyperthreading is enabled).

See the :ref:`section on repos <building_from_source>` for more
details/options.


PyPy
----

PyPy 5.7 and 5.8 have a built-in module ``cppyy``.
You can still install the ``cppyy`` package, but the built-in module takes
precedence.
To use ``cppyy``, first import a compatibility module::

 $ pypy
 [PyPy 5.8.0 with GCC 5.4.0] on linux2
 >>>> import cppyy_compat, cppyy
 >>>>

You will have to set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` appropriately if you get an
``EnvironmentError`` (it will indicate the needed directory).

Note that your python interpreter (whether CPython or ``pypy-c``) may not have
been linked by the C++ compiler.
This can lead to problems during loading of C++ libraries and program shutdown.
In that case, re-linking is highly recommended.

Older versions of PyPy (5.6.0 and earlier) have a built-in ``cppyy`` based on
`Reflex`_, which is less feature-rich and no longer supported.
However, both the :doc:`distribution tools <dictionaries>` and user-facing
Python codes are very backwards compatible.


Precompiled Header
------------------

For performance reasons (reduced memory and CPU usage), a precompiled header
(PCH) of the system and compiler header files will be installed or, failing
that, generated on startup.
Obviously, this PCH is not portable and should not be part of any wheel.

Some compiler features, such as AVX, OpenMP, fast math, etc. need to be
active during compilation of the PCH, as they depend both on compiler flags
and system headers (for intrinsics, or API calls).
You can control compiler flags through the ``EXTRA_CLING_ARGS`` envar and thus
what is active in the PCH.
In principle, you can also change the C++ language standard by setting the
appropriate flag on ``EXTRA_CLING_ARGS`` and rebuilding the PCH.
However, if done at this stage, that disables some automatic conversion for
C++ types that were introduced after C++11 (such as string_view and optional).

If you want multiple PCHs living side-by-side, you can generate them
yourself (note that the given path must be absolute)::

 >>> import cppyy_backend.loader as l
 >>> l.set_cling_compile_options(True)         # adds defaults to EXTRA_CLING_ARGS
 >>> install_path = '/full/path/to/target/location/for/PCH'
 >>> l.ensure_precompiled_header(install_path)

You can then select the appropriate PCH with the ``CLING_STANDARD_PCH`` envar::

 $ export CLING_STANDARD_PCH=/full/path/to/target/location/for/PCH/allDict.cxx.pch

Or disable it completely by setting that envar to "none".
