    "This tutorial introduces pythonizations and how they can be used to solve low-level problems.\n",

    "The setup: imagine you want to use numpy, but are given a C or C++ library that is based on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). How do make the two of them play nice together?\n",
    "\n",
    "GSL is written in C, but is very structured: it has consistent naming conventions, provides allocators/deallocators for its main structs, and has clear ownership rules. Because of this structure, it is possible to write pythonizations based on reflection information that end up being very simple and therefore easy to maintain."

This is overkill for simple projects, but if we want access to all of GSL (as opposed to GSL and GSLBLAS separately, say), this approach is fine."

We then run the genreflex command to generate the dictionary file and compile it, linking in GSL and GSLBLAS. Finally, we're ready to load the dictionary reflection file into cppyy."
