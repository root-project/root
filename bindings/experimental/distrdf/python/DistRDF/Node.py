class Node(object):
    """
    A Class that represents a node in RDataFrame operations graph. A Node
    houses an operation and has references to children nodes.
    For details on the types of operations supported, try :

    Example::

        import DistRDF
        DistRDF.use(...) # Choose your backend
        print(DistRDF.current_backend.supported_operations)

    Attributes:
        get_head (function): A lambda function that returns the head node of
            the current graph.

        operation: The operation that this Node represents.
            This could be :obj:`None`.

        children (list): A list of :obj:`DistRDF.Node` objects which represent
            the children nodes connected to the current node.

        _new_op_name (str): The name of the new incoming operation of the next
            child, which is the last child node among the current node's
            children.

        value: The computed value after executing the operation in the current
            node for a particular DistRDF graph. This is permanently :obj:`None`
            for transformation nodes and the action nodes get a
            :obj:`ROOT.RResultPtr` after event-loop execution.

        pyroot_node: Reference to the PyROOT object that implements the
            functionality of this node on the cpp side.

        has_user_references (bool): A flag to check whether the node has
            direct user references, that is if it is assigned to a variable.
            Default value is :obj:`True`, turns to :obj:`False` if the proxy
            that wraps the node gets garbage collected by Python.
    """

        """
