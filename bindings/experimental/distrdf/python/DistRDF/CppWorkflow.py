class CppWorkflow(object):
    '''
    Class that encapsulates the generation of the code of an RDataFrame workflow
    in C++, together with its compilation into a shared library and execution.

    This class is used by worker processes to execute in C++ the RDataFrame
    graph they receive. This is done for the sake of performance, since running
    the graph from Python necessarily relies on jitted code, which is less
    optimized and thus slower than a shared library compiled with ACLiC.

    Attributes:
        action_res_types (dict): result types for each supported action.

        cached_wfs (set): ids of workflow functions that have been already
            compiled and loaded by the current process. Used to prevent
            recompilation of already executed workflow functions.

        FUNCTION_NAME (string): name of the function that encapsulates the
            RDataFrame graph creation

        FUNCTION_NAMESPACE (string): namespace of the function that
            encapsulates the RDataFrame graph creation

        graph_nodes (list): statements that add nodes to the graph.

        includes (list): include statements needed by the workflow.

        lambdas (list): lambda functions used by the workflow.

        lambda_id (int): counter used to generate ids for each defined lambda
            function.

        node_id (int): counter used to generate ids for each graph node.

        py_actions (list): list that contains PyActionData pairs
            `(res_id,operation)`, where `res_id` is the Python action result
            index in the vector of workflow results and `operation` is the
            Operation object corresponding to the action.

        res_ptr_id (int): counter used to generate ids for each result generated
            by graph actions.

        snapshots (list): list that contains SnapshotData pairs
            `(res_id,filename)`, where `res_id` is the Snapshot result index in
            the vector of workflow results and `filename` is its modified output
            file name.
