<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> The PDF file produced by the following macro was not readable by Acrobat
     reader:
     <pre>
     {
        TCanvas* can = new TCanvas("can");
        double margin = 1e-10;
        can->Divide(2, 2, margin, margin);
        TH1D* hist = new TH1D("hist" , "", 1, 0, 1);
        hist->Draw();
        can->SaveAs("can.pdf");
     }
     </pre>
     because Acrobat does not work when a PDF file contains reals with
     exponents, which is the cavse with the file "can.pdf". This problem is
     now fixed. Note that "can.pdf" could be read by "ghostview" and printed.
<li> PDF file now use the fonts encoding <tt>WinAnsiEncoding</tt>. This allows
     to print any characters with accent etc.. like on the screen. An similar
     modification was done in the previous release for PostScript.
</ul>

<h4>SVG</h4>
<ul>
<li> Some SVG viewer need a more complete header: &quot;width&quot; and
     &quot;height&quot; attributes
     in the svg tag and a &quot;xml&quot; tag to start the file.
     (Found by Hubert Degaudenzi &lt;Hubert.Degaudenzi@cern.ch&gt;)
</ul>

<h4>PostScript</h4>
<ul>
<li> Since the new font endocing (June release) the hyphen was longer than
     before. Now fixed.
<li> When drawn with an angle, the "tilde" character as an acceent was not
     correctly placed in a PostScript file. For instance:
<pre>
   {
      TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1", "c1",15,49,700,530);
      TLatex *tex1 = new TLatex(0.5,0.5,"#tilde{C}");
      tex1->SetTextSize(0.2);
      tex1->SetTextAngle(90);
      tex1->Draw();
      c1->Print("tilde.ps");
   }
</pre>
</ul>

<h4>TASImage / libAfterImage</h4>
<ul>
<li> Synchronizing libAfterImage with Sasha'a latest version.
<li> <tt>TASImage::Merge (const TImage im, const char op, Int_t x, Int_t y) </tt>
     with x and/or y not equal 0 did not clip the overlayed picture correctly.
<li> Make sure a rectangle drawn will <tt>TAsimage::DrawRectangle</tt> appears
     after calling <tt>gPad->Modified()</tt>.
<li> Images can be saved (canvas->Print) from within threads.
</ul>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<h4>TColor</h4>
<ul>
<li> <tt>CreateGradientColorTable</tt> now calls
     <tt>TColor::InitializeColors()</tt>. This is needed because is some cases
     <tt>TColor::InitializeColors()</tt> has not been called before and the
     following erro messages were issued:
     <pre>
     Warning in <TColor::TColor>: color 1 already defined
     Warning in <TColor::TColor>: color 2 already defined
     Warning in <TColor::TColor>: color 3 already defined
     [...]
     </pre>
<li> <tt>TColor::AsHexString</tt> was not returning the proper value in case
     of gray scale mode. Before this change gray scale mode did not work in
     pictures generated in batch.
</ul>

<h4>TLatex</h4>

TLatex in now centered vertically like TText. When centered vertically, TLatex
was not aligned on the control box. Some additionnal tiny adjustment of one
pixel was also needed in order to look better when the text is enclosed in a box
like in TPaveText.

<h4>TPaveText</h4>

The vertical text aligment is now done using the text alignment attributes
instead of the trick used before. Histograms' titles are look much better
centered vertically after this modification.

<h4>TGraph</h4>

<tt>TGraph::DrawPanel</tt> is now implemented.

<h4>TGraphErrors</h4>

The drawing option &quot;[]&quot; has been change to &quot;||&quot;. The new
option &quot;[]&quot; is the same as &quot;||&quot; except that some ticks are
drawn at the end of the horizontal and vertical lines at the end of the error
bars. This new way of drawing the option "[]" shows better to which error
bar the additional tick marks belong. The following example, which has been
provided by Thomas Ullrich <thomas.ullrich@bnl.gov>, shows it clearly.

<h4>TGraphPolargram.cxx</h4>

An extra empty canvas was created each time a <tt>TGraphPolar</tt> was painted
in "Not Editable" mode.

<h4>TPad</h4>

Improvments in <tt>TPad::BuildLegend</tt>: If the pad contains some
<tt>TMultiGraph</tt> or <tt>THStack</tt> the individual graphs or histograms
in them are automatically added to the <tt>TLegend</tt> produced by
<tt>TPad::BuildLegend</tt>.

<h4>TGaxis</h4>

When drawn with the option
X+ or Y+ the histogram axis were wrong in
case of alphanumeric labels. The tick marks were in the right
place but the labels were not.
