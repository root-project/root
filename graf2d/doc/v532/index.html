<h3>2D Graphics Libraries</h3>

<h4>TCanvas</h4>
<ul>
<li>The following sequence produced a <tt>SEG FAULT</tt>:
   <pre>
   root [0] TFile f("can.root")
   root [1] TCanvas* can = (TCanvas*)f.Get("can")
   root [2] gROOT->SetBatch(1)
   root [3] can->Draw()
   </pre>
</li>
<li>Make sure the inspector canvas background is white.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraphPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li> New option E5. It draws boxes for the errors like option E2 but in addition
   it allows to draw the border of the boxes.

   </center>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TSVG - TPDF</h4>
<ul>
<li>When saving canvas as an svg image, the "times" character (i. e. in "x10^3"
statement above axis) was saved as utf "&#0772;" (combining macron) whereas it 
schould be "&#215;" (multiplication sign). It is now fixed.
</li>
<li> <tt>TSVG::Open</tt> and <tt>TPDF::Open</tt> now check if the output file 
was successfully opened.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TText</h4>
<ul>
<li> <tt>TText::GetBoundingBox</tt> now returns 0 when the string is empty.
Previously it returned undefined numbers.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TLegend</h4>
<ul>
<li> Rewrite <tt>TLegend::GetEntry()</tt> to take the number of columns in the
legend into account. The previous version considered there was always only one
column in a <tt>TLegend</tt>.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TPaveLabel</h4>
<ul>
<li>The following macro entered an infinite loop: 
<pre>
   {
      int x[10], y[10]; int i;
      for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {x[i] = 10*i;y[i] = i;}
      TGraph *gr = new TGraph(10,x,y);
      gr->Draw("AL");  
      TPaveLabel *hello = new TPaveLabel(0.2,0.4,0.8,0.6,"Hello World");
      hello->Draw();
   }
</pre>
<li>
</ul>

<h4>iOS module</h4>
<ul>
<li>New module 'ios' was added into graf2d to make it possible to use ROOT's graphics on iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod touch).<br>
    Among other things, it has the ROOT::iOS::Pad class, which is a version of TPad for iOS (pad with TF2 example below).<br>
<center>
<img alt="TF2 object in a ROOT::iOS::Pad" title="TF2 object in a ROOT::iOS::Pad (painted with a transparency)" src="iospad.gif"/>
</center><br>
    Two applications, based on this module, were developed for iOS (currently, for iPad only): "Tutorials" and "RootBrowser".
    They can be found in $ROOTSYS/test/ios.
</li><br><br>

<li>
   <b>"Tutorials" app</b><br><br>
   Small application with several demos, "iOS version" of the $ROOTSYS/tutorlas/demos.C.<br>
   <center>
   <img alt="Tutorials app" title="Tutorials app" src="tutorials.gif"/>
   </center>
   <br><b>"Tutorials" application:</b><br>
   <pre>
   <ul>
      <li>supports portrait and landscape orientation</li>
      <li>has several demos (can be selected by tapping on table's cells)</li>
      <li>supports different gestures (pinch, single and double tap, pan, etc. - active gestures are shown by hint icons)</li>
      <li>has "zoom" mode - pinch or double tap gesture will zoom in/out pad's contents</li>
      <li>has "selection" mode - with single tap user can select different objects inside pad - axes, histograms, pavestats etc.; 3D objects can be rotated.</li>
      <li>has a simple editor to modify pad's parameters : fill color, logarithmic scale, grid, ticks, etc.</li>
   </ul>
   </pre>
   <center>
   <img alt="Editor" title="Pad's editor" src="tut_editor.gif"/>
   </center>
</li><br><br>

<li>
   <b>"RootBrowser" app</b><br><br>
   This application is a simplified version of TBrowser and TCanvas for iOS. User can open ROOT's file (application uses TWebFile) and browse file's contents.<br>
   RootBrower registeres *.root file extension in a system, so for example, attached root files from a mail client can be opened by RootBrowser.<br><br>
   Application has several views. In a top level view, user can see opened files, open new files, close files (long press gesture on a file icon):<br><br>
   <center>
   <img alt="Top level view" title="Top level view" src="top_level.gif"/>
   </center>
   <br><br>
   Tap gesture on a file's icon will open "File contents" view. This view shows objects and nested directories. For objects small previews are<br>
   generated. Tapping on a directory's icon will open new view with directory's contents. Simple search is supported (in the current TDirectoryFile).<br><br>
   <center>
   <img alt="File contents view" title="File's contents view" src="file_contents.gif"/>
   </center>
   <br><br>
   Tap on a object's preview will open detailed view for this object. Using pinch gesture or double tap, you can zoom in/zoom out pad's contents.<br>
   If you have several objects in a file or directory, you can navigate through directory contents by using swipe gesture, scrolling your objects.<br><br>
   <center>
   <img alt="Detail view" title="Detail view" src="detail_view.gif"/>
   </center>
   <br><br>
   It's possible to modify properties of objects the same way you can do it in TCanvas - RootBrowser has an editor. After you press "Edit" button, you can
   pick histogram, axis, frame, pavestats, etc. in a pad and modify its properties in the editor (selected object is highlihgted in a pad). <br>At the moment, there are editors for:
   <pre>
   <ul>
   <li>TH1 objects</li>
   <li>TGraph objects</li>
   <li>Objects derived from TAttLine (line attributes)</li>
   <li>Objects derived from TAttFill (filled area attributes)</li>
   <li>Pad object (fill properties, log scales, ticks, grid)</li>
   <li>Markers</li>
   </ul>
   </pre><br><br>
   <center>
   <img alt="Editors" title="Editors" src="editors.gif"/>
   </center>
   <br><br>
   Using pan gesture along the selected axis, you can change the axis range - "zoom".<br>
   Mofigied object can be saved locally (in application's directory) and send as mail attachment <br>
   ("Save" functionality will be improved soon).
</li>
</ul>
