<h3>Graphical Output</h3>

<h4>TASImage / libAfterImage</h4>
<ul>

<li> In <tt>TImageDump</tt> the way the markers 6 and 7 are drawn
     (medium dot and big dot) has been changed to make sure they have
     the same size as the one on screen.
<li> Changes in libAfterImage (draw.c & draw.h), TASImage.cxx
     and TImageDump.cxx in order to produce nice looking
     circular (hollow and solid) markers. Previously the line
     used to draw hollow circular markers looked very thick and
     the solid ones did not look circular.
<li> Remove the global variable named "dpy" in libAfterImage. It produced
     an error if a user program used that simple variable name. "dpy"
     was a pointer to a "Display".
</ul>

<h4>PostScript and PDF</h4>
<ul>
<li> Now, a text with size 0 is not drawn in PDF files. An invalid
     PDF file is created if a text with size 0 is produced.
<li> The landscape orientation is now correct in pdf files. gv recognizes
     the files as "Landscape" and the orientation is not upside down
     as it was before (seascape).
<li> In PostScript and PDF files the method <tt>DrawPS</tt> is used to write
     a single (x,y) position.
     This case was not treated correctly and, because of that, the PS and PDF
     files might contain useless attributes settings. That was only a few
     bytes more in the file but they were useless.
</ul>

<h4>TLegend</h4>
<ul>
<li> When a object is added "by name" in a legend, the
  TMultiGraph and THStack present in the current pad
  are scanned if an object with this name has not been
  found in the pad. Previously the graphs and histograms
  were hidden in multi-graphs and histogram-stacks when one
  tried to add them by name.
<li> New reference guide.
</ul>

<h4>TGaxis</h4>
<ul>
<li> In <tt>PaintAxis</tt> The option "U", for unlabeled axis, was not
     implemented in case of alphanumeric axis' labels.
<li> On log-scale TGAxis, with labels having lower values than 1 and ticks marks
  set to the positive side, alignement issues seem to come up.
  The following example shows four TGAxis drawn respectively with the
  following options: RG-, RG+, LG-, LG+. For the RG+ and LG+ options,
  the 10E-1 and 10E-2 labels were ill-aligned, showing a shift to the right
  compared to the 1E2, 1E1 and 1 labels.
  <pre>
  {
     c1 = new TCanvas("c1","Examples of Log TGaxis",10,10,700,500);
     c1->Range(-10,-1,10,1);
     TGaxis *axis1 = new TGaxis(-7,-0.8,-7,0.8,0.01,100,50510,"RG-");
     axis1->SetTitle("RG-"); axis1->Draw();
     TGaxis *axis2 = new TGaxis(-2,-0.8,-2,0.8,0.01,100,50510,"RG+");
     axis2->SetLabelOffset(-0.04); axis2->SetTitleOffset(-1.5);
     axis2->SetTitle("RG+"); axis2->Draw();
     TGaxis *axis3 = new TGaxis(2,-0.8,2,0.8,0.01,100,50510,"LG-");
     axis3->SetLabelOffset(-0.04);
     axis3->SetTitle("LG-"); axis3->Draw();
     TGaxis *axis4 = new TGaxis(7,-0.8,7,0.8,0.01,100,50510,"LG+");
     axis4->SetTitleOffset(-1);
     axis4->SetTitle("LG+"); axis4->Draw();
  }
  </pre>
<li> <tt>gStyle.SetStripDecimals(kFALSE)</tt> did not work in cases like the
  following one:
  <pre>
  {
     gStyle.SetStripDecimals(kFALSE);
     gStyle.SetPadLeftMargin(.15);
     TGraph graph_freq;
     graph_freq.SetPoint(0, 933., 40078879.);
     graph_freq.SetPoint(1, 934., 40078966.);
     graph_freq.Draw("A*");
  }
  </pre>
</ul>

<h4>TCrown</h4>
<ul>
<li> The crown picking did not work.
<li> Improve help.
</ul>

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
<li> The text angle was not taken into account in case the
  text was painted in low precision like in:
  <pre>
  gStyle->SetTitleFont(60,"xy");
  TH1F* h=new TH1F("foo", "bar;#int;#int", 10, 0, 1);
  h->Draw();
  </pre>
  In that example the Y title was not rotated.
</ul>

<h4>TCanvas</h4>
<ul>
<li> A canvas is turned into GL mode only if the
  canvas name starts with "gl". Before the
  "gl" string could be anywhere in the name.
</ul>

<h4>QtRoot/ libGQt</h4>
<ul>
<li> The redundant Qt3-related code was removed.
<li> The Q3_SUPPORT  flag was eliminated.
     The plug-in can be used with and without Q3_SUPPORT now.
<li> The code was adjusted to work under the Qt 4.5.x.
<li> Many platform depended (win32) sections
     were replaced with the cross-platform code
</ul>
