<h4>TPDF</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      The table of content entries were not correct if there was and extra option
      before "Title:".
   </li>
   <li>
      After a title was once set, this title will be used for all following
      additions to the PDF file, instead of "Page ###".
   </li>
   <li>
      Better sizes matching with the screen output for markers 6 and 7 (dots).

      Implement the transparency in PDF files. To make a graphics object transparent
      it is enough to set its color to a transparent one. The color transparency
      is defined via its alpha component. The alpha value varies from 0. to 1.
      0. makes an object fully transparent, and 1. makes it fully opaque. To set the
      alpha value of an existing color it is enough to do:
      <pre>
         TColor *col26 = gROOT->GetColor(26);
         col26->SetAlpha(0.01);
      </pre>
      A new color can be created transparent the following way:
      <pre>
         Int_t ci = 1756;
         TColor *color = new TColor(ci, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5); // alpha = 0.5
      </pre>
      An example of tranparency usage with parallel coordinates can be found
      in <tt>$ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/parallelcoordtrans.C</tt>
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TSVG</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      Implement the transparency in SVG files (cf TPDF).
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TLegend</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      The option E, to draw the error bar on a legend entry, does not need
      anymore the option L to be active. It is now possible to draw the error
      bar only using the option E alone. The combination of the options E and L
      still works as before.
   </li>
   <li>
      The text attributes were not properly initialized by the default
      constructor.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TLatex</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      Implement <tt>#mp</tt>.
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>TPad</h4>
<ul>
   <li>
      New method DivideSquare a canvas in to  n sub-pads. The number of sub-pads
      along the X and Y axis are computed according to the square root of n.
      Example:
   <pre>
      void divsquare(int w, int h, int n)
      {
         TCanvas *c = new TCanvas ("c","c",0,0,w,h);
         c->DivideSquare(n);
         for (int i=1; i&lt;=n; i++) {
            c->cd(i);
            gPad->DrawFrame(0,0,1,1);
         }
      }
   </pre>
   </li>
   <li> TPad::Print always use TImageDump to print gif, png and jpeg files, in
      interactive and batch mode (previously it was used in the batch case only).
      This allows to generate output transparent colors in these formats even in
      interactive mode. The generation of gif, png and jpeg files from the
      graphics window in interactive mode is kept for OpenGL canvases.
   </li>
</ul>
<h4>New graphical back-end for MacOSX</h4>
<p align="justify">
TGCocoa/TGQuartz classes are the implementation of TVirtualX based on Cocoa and Quartz 2D.
They let to use ROOT's GUI and graphics on MacOS X without installing X11.app and also give an access to Apple's native
graphics and GUI frameworks. Window management, event loop, event dispatching, etc. are implemented on top of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoa_(API)">Cocoa</a>.
Graphics (GUI rendering and non-GUI) is done by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_2D">Quartz 2D (Core Graphics)</a>.
An example of a TCanvas with a THStack object, transparency, anti-aliasing, gradient fill, shadows:
</p>
<img alt="Transparency and gradients" width="750" height="484" title="Transparency and gradients" src="quartz2d.gif"/>
<br />ROOT must be configured with <strong>--enable-cocoa</strong> parameter to use Cocoa back-end instead of X11 version.
<strong>Please note</strong>, this is still a work in progress.
