<h3>TPDF</h3>
<ul>
<li> The following macro produed a wrong PDF file. The second page had a black
     background.
     <pre>
     {
        gROOT->SetStyle("Plain");
        TCanvas*  canvas = new TCanvas("canvas", "canvas", 600, 700);
        TH1F* h = new TH1F("h","ht", 100, -5, 5);
        h->FillRandom("gaus",10000);
        canvas->Divide(2,1);
        canvas->cd(1); h->Draw();
        canvas->Update();
        canvas->Print("test.pdf(");
        canvas->Print("test.pdf");
        canvas->Print("test.pdf)");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPostscript</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fix a precision problem in the text positionning. When the pad limits along
     X or Y were very close the text position might be wrong. This was found 
     thanks to the test #15 in stressGraphics. The text position is now computed
     using double precision variables only.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TGaxis</h3>
<ul>
<li> The following macro produced two different labelling. Label "3" was missing
     on the axis "b".
     <pre>
     {
        TGaxis *a = new TGaxis(0.2,0.5,0.8,0.5,0.2,3.5,510,"G");
        a->SetMoreLogLabels(1); a->Draw();
        TGaxis *b = new TGaxis(0.8,0.7,0.2,0.7,0.2,3.5,510,"G");
        b->SetMoreLogLabels(1); b->Draw();
     }
     </pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Add a protection in <tt>TPad:Clear()</tt> to fix the
    bug report #78382. An histogram redrawing in a cloned
    pad produced a segmentation fault.</li>
</ul>
