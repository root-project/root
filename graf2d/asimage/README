Some files have been modified compare to the official libAfterImage version:

   config.h.in has been modified in order to use freetype from the ROOT
   repository.

   libjpeg/jcmainct.c libjpeg/jdmainct.c have been modified to avoid a
   compilation warning. These two pieces of code contain a variable called
   "main" (some compiler do not like this). This variable name has been
   changed to "mainptr".

   libjpeg/jmorecfg.h generated a warning on Windows: "a benign redifinition".
   This warning has been disabled.

   libjpeg/jconfig.h: disable INLINE definition.

   libjpeg/jidctred.c: removed from repository (replaced by jidctint.c)

   libjpeg/jmorecfg.h and libjpeg/jconfig.h: fix a problem with boolean.

   configure.in: support clang++ by removing some warnings.

   configure:
   - has been modified to look at the ".dylib" file extension to find
     the X11 libraries. This is needed on the Mac Leopard system.
   - the compiling option -Winline has been removed because it produced many
     warnings with gcc 4.3.
   - support clang++ by removing some warnings.

   libAfterImage.mak:
   Remove the word "Warning" in the message
   "Warning: cannot find "libAfterImage.dep" to prevent to SPI
   nightly build to issue an error.

   import.c: to fix the warning (on SLC5):
   "warning: dereferencing type-punned pointer will break strict-aliasing rules"

   import.c and ungif.c (Ubuntu gcc 4.4):
   "warning: ignoring return value of 'fread', declared with attribute warn_unused_result"

   export.c: to fix a warning on Open Solaris:
   "initializer will be sign-extended: -1"

   export.c and import.c:
   OSX Lion comes with builtin libpng 1.5.1 which obsoletes some 1.2 constructs

   asimage.c, char2uni.c, export.c, imencdec.c:
   - fix a warning with clang:
     "comparison of unsigned enum expression < 0 is always false"

Note:
The file afterbase.h gets autogenerated by configure from afterbase.h.in
if afterbase.h.in has not changed, afterbase.h remains unchanged.
