This directory contains libAfterImage core code.

Here is how to build and install it :

libAfterImage may utilize libAfterBase, for some of the low level
tasks, or it may run standalone, using its own subset of
libAfterBase. It is recommended to use libAfterBase whenever
possible, as it provides more functionality, and you may
actually utilize it in your programs for various tasks, such as
hash tables, file searching, etc.

Both libraries can be built and installed by simply executing :

  ./configure ; make ; make install

in respective directory.

libAfterImage will install itself into /usr/local/lib on most
systems. In addition it will install afterimage-libs script to
/usr/local/bin. This script can be used to query what libraries
libAfterImage is dependant on. All of this libraries has to be
linked to, while building an application utilizing libAfterImage.
Header files for the library will be installed into
/usr/local/include/libAfterImage on most systems.
