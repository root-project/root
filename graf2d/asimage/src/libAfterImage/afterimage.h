/****h* libAfterImage/libAfterImage
 * NAME
 * libAfterImage - generic imaging library originally designed for 
 * AfterStep X Window Manager.
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * libAfterImage is the imaging library implemented for AfterStep
 * X Window Manager. It has been generalized to be suitable for any
 * application in need of robust graphics engine.
 *
 * It provides facilities for loading images from files of different
 * formats, compressed in memory storage of images, scaling,
 * tinting/shading, flipping and superimposition of arbitrary number of
 * images over each other. In addition it allows for linear gradients
 * drawing, and antialiased/smoothed text drawing using both  FreeType
 * library and X Window fonts.
 *
 * Primary goals of this library are to achieve exceptional quality of
 * images and text, making code fast and small at the same time.
 * Additional steps are taken to compensate for screen colordepth
 * limitation, and different error diffusion algorithms are used to
 * provide for smooth images even in low colordepth modes.
 *
 * HISTORY
 * libAfterImage has been implemented as an attempt to address several
 * issues. First one, and most important is that X Window System
 * completely lacks any tools for image manipulation, except for very
 * rudimentary operations. With Introduction of Render extentions in
 * XFree86 4.0 that situation is changing, but still is far from
 * perfect. There need is therefore to implement client side image
 * manipulation. That inturn creates a problem of image data transfer
 * between Server and client.
 *
 * To avoid that full-time image storage on the client side is needed.
 * Which is memory extensive. So there appears to be a need for some
 * in-memory compression.
 *
 * On the other side there is an image quality issue. Its easy to write
 * a scaling function by simply dropping out or duplicating pixels,
 * but quality is awfull. What is needed is very fast
 * averaging/interpolation code. That brings us to the issue of 8 bits
 * per channel. Add two pixels together and you get overflow. So all the
 * math has to be performed in different colorspace and then converted
 * back. On the other side, such a conversion may discard valuable bits,
 * so some compensation method has to be implemented.
 *
 * On the text drawing side of things, there are numerous problems just
 * as well. Native X fonts look ugly as soon as you try to show any
 * decently sized text. That is supposed to be solved with said Render
 * extensions to XFree86, but as experiense has shown, things aren't as
 * easy as it looks, besides one wants one's app to run well under any X
 * Server. FreeType library provides a solution, but not always
 * available. Another problem is that if you keep all your images on the
 * client side, you want to draw text on client side as well.
 *
 * The solution is to provide transparent interface that could use both
 * X fonts and FreeType, cache glyphs on the client side and possibly
 * perform smoothing of ugly X fonts.
 *
 * There is no library solving all this problems in one fell swoop,
 * except for monstrous ones, like ImLib.
 *
 * Hence libAfterImage has come to life.
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * libAfterStep provides sevarl facilities.
 *
 * 1. X Visual abstruction layer via ASVisual. This layer handles color
 * management, transfer of data to and from X Server, and other screen
 * related stuff.
 *
 * 2. Scanline handling facility via ASScanline. ASScanline is the most
 * widely used structure since image handling is implemented on
 * per-scanline basis.
 *
 * 3. Image storage, trasformation and rendering via ASImage. ASImage
 * provides for generic container used for any image or text
 * manipulation. It incorporates such a robust facilities as in-memory
 * RLE compression, separate channel storage of 4 channels ( Alpha, Red,
 * Green, and Blue ) with 8 bit per channel.
 *
 * 4. Simplified font handling facility via ASFont and ASFointManager.
 * All the font handling is done using ASFont structure, no matter what
 * type of font is used. Any font supported by X11 and FreeType can be
 * used.
 *
 * 5. Transparent image file reading for many different formats. Included
 * built-in XPM reading code and XCF ( GIMP's native format ).
 * Overall supported:
 * via external libraries :
 * XPM, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, GIF
 * via built in code :
 * XPM, XCF, PNM, PPM, BMP, ICO, CUR
 * Note that XPM can be supported both via built-in code or via libXpm,
 * depending on compilation configuration.
 * Actuall image file format is autodetected from the file contents -
 * file name extention is not used and can be anything at all.
 *
 * 6. Image export into many popular file formats. Currently implemented :
 * XPM, JPEG, PNG, GIF. Work is underway to implement support for TIFF,
 * XCF, BMP, ICO.
 *
 * 7. Image quantization to arbitrary size colormap.
 *
 * 8. libAfterImage could be used without X window system, which is
 * coninient for such thing as web development. XML Image manipulation
 * tool, that could be used in such activity is included (see ascompose.c)
 *
 * 9. Image reference counting
 *
 * USES
 * libAfterBase - AfterStep basic functionality library. That Includes
 * Hash tables, file search methods, message output, generic types.
 * However effort has been made to allow for standalone configuration as
 * well. If libAfterBase is not found at compilation time - libAfterImage
 * will use extract from libAfterBase included with libAfterImage.
 *
 * SEE ALSO
 * Examples
 * API Reference
 *
 * TODO
 * Implement support for Targa and PCX image format and maybe some other
 * formats as well.
 *
 * Implement complete support for I18N internationalization.
 *
 * Implement color<->pixel conversion for all colordepths.
