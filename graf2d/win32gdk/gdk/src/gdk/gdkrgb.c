   This assumes native byte ordering - what should really be done is to
   check whether static_image->byte_order is consistent with the _ENDIAN
   config flag, and if not, use a different function.

   This routine is faster than the one included with Gtk 1.0 for a number
   of reasons:

   1. Shifting instead of lookup tables (less memory traffic).

   2. Much less register pressure, especially because shifts are
   in the code.

   3. A memcpy is avoided (i.e. the transfer function).

   4. On big-endian architectures, byte swapping is avoided.

   That said, it wouldn't be hard to make it even faster - just make an
   inner loop that reads 3 words (i.e. 4 24-bit pixels), does a lot of
   shifting and masking, then writes 2 words.
