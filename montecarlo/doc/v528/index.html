<h3>MonteCarlo</h3>
<h4>TDatabasePDG</h4>
The method ReadPDGTable of TDatabasePDG was setting the stable flags for
all particles regardless of their width.

<h4>TParticlePDG</h4>
The value reported in the fLifetime variable of TParticlePDG is in seconds
while in the documentation is was indicated in nanoseconds.

<h4>pdg_table.txt</h4>
Particles with a width greater than 1e-10 have now the stable flag set to 1.

<h4>TVirtualMC</h4>
New functions added in the interface:
<ul>
<li>For activation of collecting TGeo tracks:
<pre>virtual void SetCollectTracks(Bool_t collectTracks);
virtual Bool_t IsCollectTracks() const;
</pre>
<li>For accessing the normal vector of the crossing volume surface
on the geometry boundary:
<pre>virtual Bool_t CurrentBoundaryNormal(Double_t &x, Double_t &y, Double_t &z) const;
</pre>
</ul>
