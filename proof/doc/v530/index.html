<h3>Proof</h3>
<ul>
  <li>New functionality
    <ul>
      <li>In TProof::Load, add the possibility to define a list of files to be
        sent because needed by the main macro file. The list is comma-separated
        and the first file is considered as the main one. For example<br>
        <br>
        &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
        proof-&gt;Load("&lt;macropath&gt;/mymacro.C+,&lt;thispath&gt;/thisheader.h,&lt;thatpath&gt;/thatheader.h")<br>
        <br>
        will make sure that the files 'thisheader.h' and 'thatheader.h', needed
        by 'mymacro.C' are available in the sandbox on the worker machines.
        Note that 'thisheader.h' and 'thatheader.h' will be available remotely
        in the sandbox, as 'mymacro.C'; so they should be included directly by
        'mymacro.C', e.g. '#include "thisheader.h"' .</li>
      <li>Import the dataset stager daemon 'afdsmgrd' into ROOT; this is used
        to manage data staging based on the dataset information (see
        http://code.google.com/p/afdsmgrd/ for more info). The daemon is
        located under $ROOTSYS/proof/afdsmgrd .</li>
      <li>New PROOF bench suite, a framework to run CPU and IO benchmarks with
        default selectors/data or with user-provided ones. The code is located
        under proof/proofbench. See
        http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/new-benchmark-framework-tproofbench
      .</li>
      <li>Add the possibility to access the files on the workers via the same
        port used by PROOF. This is useful for cases when it is not possible to
        start a file server daemon on a different port (because, for eample, of
        a firewall or just inconvenience) and workers do not share a file
        system. Internally this works by forking a 'rootd' after identifying a
        file request and trasferring the connection to it. The client side is a
        TNetFile and it is triggered by the protocol "rootd://" (the just
        implemented etc/plugins/TFile/P120_TNetFile.C includes this
        protocol).<br>
        See also
        http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/configuration-reference-guide#rootd
      .</li>
      <li>Add support for log file truncation. Truncation is disabled by
        default. Enabling is controlled by the rootrc variable<br>
        <br>
        &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;
        ProofServ.LogFileMaxSize&#xa0;&#xa0;
        {&lt;bytes&gt;|&lt;kilobytes&gt;K|&lt;megabytes&gt;M|&lt;gigabytes&gt;G}<br>
        <br>
        &#xa0;indicating the max number of bytes. The number can be followed by
        a {K,M,G} to indicate KBytes, MBytes or GBytes, respectively.</li>
      <li>Add new derivation of TList (TProofOutputList) to be used on the
        PROOF client to filter out PROOF internal objects when displaying or
        printing the list. By default objects was names start with 'PROOF_' are
        not shown. The presence of a non empty missing file list is
      notified.</li>
      <li>In the PROOF monitoring to: send additional information about memory
        usage during the query, the name and size (# of files) of the dataset
        processed (if any); add possibility to send the information to multiple
        monitoring collectors. See documentation updated at
        http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/enabling-query-monitoring .</li>
      <li>Add support for block activation/deactivation of workers.</li>
      <li>Add possibility to start the proofserv with 'system()' instead of
        'fork()' as done in PROOF-Lite. A new switch 'usefrk' has been added to
        'xpd.proofservmgr' to control that. Default is still fork().</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Improvements
    <ul>
      <li>In TProof::ClearPackages, use the manager to execute the command on
        all known worker machines. Improves the consistency when re-istalling
        packages.<br>
      </li>
      <li>In TProof::GetDataSets, add support for option ':lite:'; this allows
        to fill the map with only the summary information about the datasets
        (the header of TFileCollections), significantly increasing the speed
        and the memory footprint when the number of datasets is very large.</li>
      <li>Accept '.' in user names.</li>
      <li>Add switch to control caching of the files read on MacOsX. A call to
        fcntl(fd, F_NOCACHE, 1) is done after opening the file.</li>
      <li>Add export of the envs ROOTPROOFCLIENT and ROOTPROOFLITE when
        appropriate. These allow to steer building and/or enabling of PAR files
        in PROOF-INF/BUILD.sh and/or PROOF-INF/SETUP.C, improving transparency
        between normal ROOT and PROOF. The example PAR
        'tutorials/proof/event.par' has been modified to check the two
        variables.</li>
      <li>Fix a few issues in SQL PROOF monitoring: in
        TSQLMonitoringWriter::SendParameters, drop ''' around field names in
        the INSERT string; also use TString::Format(...) instead of Form(...)
        where relevant.&#xa0; In TPerfStats: call 'proofgroup' instead of
        'group' the field with the PROOF group (interference with the 'group'
        keyword in SQL); add new field 'querytag' VARCHAR(64) with the unique
        query tag; in WriteQueryLog fill also the field 'totevents'; in
        PacketEvent, add switch to control whether to send te information to
        the monitoring system on per packet level (may be too much for SQL).
        The switch is called fMonitorPerPacket and it is globally controlled by
        the rootrc variable 'Proof.MonitorPerPacket' and at session level with
        the parameter PROOF_MonitorPerPacket .</li>
      <li>Improve treatment of the case when temporary files are asked to be
        created on a shared file system not containing the sandboxes. This
        case, which seems to be a rather common one, should be now fully
        supported.</li>
      <li>Correctly honour selector abort status settings
        TSelector::kAbortProcess and TSelector::kAbortFile.</li>
      <li>Improve reporting of the non-processed {files, events} in the final
        'MissingFiles' list.&#xa0; </li>
      <li>Improved algorithm for TPacketizerUnit to fix issue with non
        homogeneous machines.</li>
      <li>Improve the way the information about log files is saved in case of
        failures. The log paths for these failing now should be now correctly
        saved and accessible via TProofLog.</li>
      <li>Improve merging of histograms. Just use TH1::Add whne the axis are
        equal; much faster than TH1::Merge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixes
    <ul>
      <li>In TDataSetManagerFile::NotifyUpdate fix handling of the case when
        the global list file does not exist yet (new dataset directory). Fixes
        error messages during editing dataset operations.</li>
      <li>Fix issue with machine names consistency when working on a local
        machine ('localhost' or 'localhost.localdomain' are mapped to
        gSystem-&gt;HostName()); solves possible matching problems in the
        packetizer.</li>
      <li>In TProofServ, fill the "grand total" message with more blanks, so
        that no remnants of the previous message are visible on the screen.</li>
      <li>In the autoconf/bonjour interface, fix issue preventing the correct
        port (the protocol one, which may be different from the application
        default) being used when registering the service. <br>
      </li>
      <li>In TProofPlayer::AddQueryResult, fix a bug affecting the order in
        whihc query results are registered when the start time is within 1
        second.</li>
      <li>Fix worker name in TSlaveLite.</li>
      <li>Fix problem with enabling packages with option 'notOnClient' in
        PROOF-Lite .</li>
      <li>Make sure the log file is flushed at the end of startup to avoid
        spurious log messages on next commands .</li>
      <li>In CreateSession(), fix an issue with the validity check for existing
        sessions .</li>
      <li>In TProofLite: fix problem with passing the 'varexp' and 'selection'
        strings for processing, preventing correct usage of the operators '|'
        and '||' in TTreeFormula.</li>
      <li>In the TProofOutputFile constructor, remove the 'localroot' prefix
        only if present in the path. Fixes possible truncation problems
        occuring when the paths are not under the localroot scope.</li>
      <li>In TXSocket and TXSlave: fix problem with the way collection over a
        socket just marked as 'bad' was interrupted; the interrupt was de facto
        ineffective, so that collection stayed always until the timeout expired
        (default: 5 minutes). Should solve some of the cases were slow response
        was experienced.</li>
      <li>Fix a problem with log path transmission when the node dies early or
        not even starts. The log path was empty and wrong was filled in when
        retrieving the log buffers, disorienting debugging.</li>
      <li>Fix a bug checking the first event which rendered ineffective the
        request for processing a subset of events in a given dataset or
      chain.</li>
      <li>In pq2-ana-dist, fix problem with the labels of the distribution
        histo occuring when machines are represented by IPs instead of
      names.</li>
      <li>Add missing calls to closedir() and TSystem::FreeDirectory, cuasing a
        large number of filedescriptors remaining opened after xproofd
        initialization.</li>
      <li>Fix a problem with the final update of the progress information
        affecting occasionally cases with skipped events.</li>
      <li>Fix merging of TproofOutputFile when using submergers (the
        intermediate files were not correctly handled).</li>
      <li>Fix the way TChain weights are transmitted to TProofDraw in
        DrawSelect operations.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>AoB
    <ul>
      <li>The class TFileMerger has been moved to 'io/io'</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
