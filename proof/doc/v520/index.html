<h3>PROOF</h3>

<ul>

  <li>New functionality

  <ul>

    <li>Dataset management

    <ul>

      <li>New class TProofDataSetManager definining the interface
of PROOF to dataset metainfo database</li>

      <li>New class TProofDataSetManagerFile implementating
TProofDataSetManager using the file system as back-end; &nbsp;the
separation is needed to load dataset menagers using different backends;
for example ATLAS foresees to have a MySQL-based implementation.</li>

      <li>The instance of the appropriate TProofDataSetManager is
instantiated via the plugin manager; by default an instance
of&nbsp;TProofDataSetManagerFile
managing the <span style="font-style: italic;">&lt;sandbox</span>&gt;/datasets
area is created. The directive 'Proof.DataSetManager' can be used to
modify the settings for&nbsp;TProofDataSetManagerFile or to load a
different dataset manager; for example, to '/pool/datasets' as area for
the dataset information, the following directive can be added to the
xrootd config file
        <p>xpd.putrc Proof.DataSetManager file dir:/pool/datasets</p>

      </li>

    </ul></li>

    <li> Interface to TProofMgr::GetSessionLogs() in the dialog
box. The graphics layout of the logbox has been re-designed, with new
buttons to grep the logs and to save them to a file. It is also
possible to choose the range of lines to be displayed and the subset of
nodes.
    </li>

    <li>Support for connection control base on the UNIX group
(new directive 'xpd.allowedgroups
&lt;grp1&gt;,&lt;grp2&gt;, ...')</li>

  </ul></li>

  <li>Improvements:

  <ul>

    <li>In the case of mismatch between the expected and actual
number of processed events, send back to the client the list of failed
packets.</li>

    <li>Implement the classic strategy of the TPacketizer in
TPacketizerAdaptive; the strategy can be changed from adaptive
(default) to TPacketizer with: "PROOF_PacketizerStrategy" parameter to
PROOF</li>

    <li>The max workers per node can now be also set in the
xrootd config file with<br clear="all">

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xpd.putrc&nbsp;
Packetizer.MaxWorkersPerNode: &lt;desired number&gt;</li>

    <li>
Make fCacheDir and fPackageDir controllable via directive
    </li>


  </ul></li>

  <li>Fixes

  <ul>

    <li>Two memory leaks in TProofServ affecting repeated runs
withing the same session</li>

    <li>
Fix a problem cleaning-up the input list on the workers
    </li>

    <li>The type of "PROOF_MaxSlavesPerNode",
&nbsp;"PROOF_ForceLocal" and
&nbsp;"PROOF_PacketAsAFraction" parameters has been changed from
Long_t to Int_t.&nbsp;</li>

    <li>TProofCondor plug-in:
      <ul>

        <li>Adapt the signatures of the main constructors of
TProofCondor and TProofPEAC
(and of the related plug-in handlers) to the one of TProof.</li>

        <li>Add the possibility to trigger the load of a generic
TProof-derived plug-in via
a directive the xrootd config file 'xpd.proofplugin', e.g.
'xpd.proofplugin condor:'</li>

      </ul>

    </li>

  </ul></li>


</ul>
