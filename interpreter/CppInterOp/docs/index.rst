Welcome to CppInterOp's documentation!
======================================


The CppInterOp library (previously LibInterOp) provides a minimalist approach
for other languages to identify C++ entities (variables, classes, etc.). This
enables interoperability with C++ code, bringing the speed and efficiency of
C++ to simpler, more interactive languages like Python.
