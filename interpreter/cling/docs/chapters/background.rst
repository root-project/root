When and why was Cling developed?
---------------------------------

Cling was first released in 2014 as the interactive, C++ interpreter in
ROOT. `ROOT <https://root.cern/>`_ is an open-source program written primarily
in C++, developed by research groups in high-energy physics including `CERN
<https://home.cern/>`_, `FERMILAB <https://www.fnal.gov/>`_ and `Princeton
<https://www.princeton.edu/>`_. ROOT is nowadays used by most high-energy
physics experiments. CERN is an European research organization that operates the
largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Its experiments collect
petabytes of data per year to be serialized, analyzed, and visualized as C++
objects. In this framework, Cling was developed with the aim to facilitate the
processing of scientific data in the field of high-energy physics .  Cling is a
core component of ROOT: it provides essential functionality for the analysis of
vast amounts of very complex data produced by the experimental high-energy
physics community by enabling (1) interactive exploration in C++, (2) dynamic
interoperability (see `cppyy <https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, an
automatic, runtime Python/C++ binder), and (3) rapid prototyping capabilities.
