Conclusion
----------

Cling is not just an interpreter, and is not just a REPL: it is a C/C++
JIT-compiler that can be embedded to your software for efficient incremental
execution of C++. Cling allows you to decide how much you want to compile
statically and how much to defer for the target platform. Cling enables
reflection and introspection information in high-performance systems such as
ROOT, or Xeus Jupyter, where it provides efficient code for performance-critical
tasks where hot-spot regions can be annotated with specific optimization
levels. You ca find more information regarding Cling's internal architecture,
functionment, user-cases, and Cling's based project into the References Chapter.
