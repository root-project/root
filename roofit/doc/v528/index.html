<h4>Profile Likelihood </h4>
<ul>
  <li>When running <tt>ProfileLikelihoodCalculator::GetHypoTest</tt>
  the user does not need anymore to clone the null parameter set. It
  is done now incide the calculator
  <li><tt>LikelihoodInterval::LowerLimit</tt>  (and UpperLimit)
  returns now a boolean flag with the status of the limit search.
  In case of a failure in finding the upper/lower limit a value of
  zero is returned instead of the min/max of the variable range
  <li><tt>LikelihoodIntervalPlot</tt> fix drawing of horizontal green
  line when limits are outside the variable range
