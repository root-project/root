<h3>RooFit</h3>

This release of ROOT contains RooFit version 3.00. A summary of new features is listed below

<h4>RooFit Web documentation moved to ROOT web site</h4>
The starting point for online RooFit documentation (Users Manual,
tutorials, slides etc) is now moved to the ROOT website<br><br>
<a href="http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/roofit"><tt>http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/roofit</tt></a>

<h4>Error visualization</h4>
It is now possible to visualize the effect of the uncertainties on parameters from a fit
on any p.d.f. or function projection. To do so use the new <tt>VisualizeError()</tt> argument
in a plotOn call

<pre>
    RooFitResult* fr = pdf->fitTo(*data,Save(),...) ;
    pdf->plotOn(frame,VisualizeError(*fr),...) ;
</pre>

Two techniques for error visualization are implemented. The default is
linear error progation, and results in an error band that is by
construction symmetric. The linear error is calculated as 
<pre>

   error(x) = Z* F_a(x) * Corr(a,a') F_a'(x)
  
   where     F_a(x) = [ f(x,a+da) - f(x,a-da) ] / 2,
  
           with f(x) = the plotted curve
                'da' = error taken from the fit result
          Corr(a,a') = the correlation matrix from the fit result
                  Z = requested significance 'Z sigma band'
  
</pre>
The linear method is fast (requires 2*N evaluations of the curve,
where N is the number of parameters), but may not be accurate in the
presence of strong correlations (~>0.9) and at Z>2 due to linear and
Gaussian approximations made.
<br><br>
Alternatively, errors can be visualized using a sampling method. In
this method a number of curves is calculated with variations of the
parameter values, as sampled from a multi-variate Gaussian p.d.f. that
is constructed from the fit results covariance matrix.  The error(x)
is determined by calculating a central interval that capture N% of the
variations for each valye of x, where N% is controlled by Z (i.e. Z=1
gives N=68%). The number of sampling curves is chosen to be such that
at least 100 curves are expected to be outside the N% interval. Intervals from
the sampling method can be asymmetric, and may perform better in the
presence of strong correlations, but may take (much) longer to
calculate. The sampling method also assumes that the uncertainty on the
parameters can modeled by a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.
<br><br>
A complete example is provided in a new tutorial macro <tt>rf610_visualerror.C</tt>,
the output of which is shown below. 
<br><br>
   <img src="roofit_524_visualerror.gif" alt="Graphics Output of macro rf610_visualerror">
<br><br>
It is also possible to visualize partial errors (from a subset of the parameters),
as shown above.


<h4>Binned dataset generation</h4>

A new method <tt>RooAbsPdf::generateBinned()</tt> has been implemented
that samples binned datasets (<tt>RooDataHist</tt>) from any
p.d.f. 
<pre>
   RooDataHist* data = pdf.generateBinned(x,10000) ; 
</pre>
This binned generation interface samples the p.d.f. at each bin
center and applies a Poisson fluctuation to each sampled value. 
The binning of the returned <tt>RooDataHist</tt> is controlled by the default
binning associated with the observables generated. To set the number
of bins in x to 200, do e.g. <tt>x.setBins(200)</tt> prior to the call
to <tt>generateBinned()</tt>
<br><br>
The binned dataset generation method does not (yet) support the concept of
prototype datasets.


<h4>New minimizer interface to Minuit2, GSLMinimizer etc...</h4>

A new minimizer interface, <tt>RooMinimizer</tt> has been added (contribution
from Alfio Lazarro). The new minimizer is similar in functionality to
the existing class <tt>RooMinuit</tt>, but supports the new ROOT abstract
minimizer interface and supports multiple minimizer packages and algorithms
through that interface.
<br><br>
The present interface of <tt>RooMinimizer</tt> is identical to that of <tt>RooMinuit</tt>
with two extensions
<ul>
<li> The <tt>setMinimizer(const char*)</tt> method allows to choose between "minuit" and "minuit2") 
     as implementation for <tt>migrad(),hesse(),minos()</tt> etc...
<li> The <tt>minimizer(const char* package, const char* alg)</tt> provides a completely generic interface
     to all minimizers, where <tt>package</tt> is the package (minuit,GSLminimizer) and <tt>alg</tt> is the algorithm (migrad) to be used
</ul>
By default, <tt>RooMinuit</tt> is still used when <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> is called, but can be overridden with
a <tt>Minimizer()</tt> named argument
<pre>
   // Minimization with MINUIT/MIGRAD through RooMinuit
   pdf->fitTo(data) ; 

   // Minimization with MINUIT/MIGRAD through RooMinimizer 
   pdf->fitTo(data,Minimizer("minuit")) ; 

   // Minimization with MINUIT2/MIGRAD through RooMinimizer 
   pdf->fitTo(data,Minimizer("minuit2")) ; 

   // Minimization with GSLMultiMin/conjugatefr through RooMinimizer
   pdf->fitTo(data,Minimizer("GSLMultiMin","conjugatefr")) ; 
</pre>

Note that installation of GSL and the ROOT MathMore package is needed to access the GSL Minimizers and that the GSL
Minimizer do not implement error analysis.


<h4>New numeric integration algorithms available</h4>

<p>RooFit can now interface all MathCore numeric intergration
algorithms. In this release <tt>ROOT::Math::AdaptiveIntegratorMultiDim</tt>,
which implements the 'Genz & Malik' algorithm has been interfaced
in <tt>RooAdaptiveIntegratorND</tt> and is now the default numeric integrator
for numeric integrations in two or more dimensions.

<p>This new default integrator has much improved stability and speed
for relatively smooth p.d.f.s in two or three dimensions and can
generally be used well for p.d.f. normalization integrals without
causing MINUIT converge problems due to numeric precision issues.

<p>In future release some more numeric integrators will be migrated to
a MathCore implementation.

<h4>Interface to TFoam adaptive MC sampler added</h4>

<p>RooFit can now use the <tt>TFoam</tt> adaptive MC sampler for event generation of p.d.f.s that
do not have an internal generator. The <tt>TFoam</tt> generator adaptively subdivides the 
observable space and is generally more efficient both warmup and generation than the original
<tt>RooAcceptReject</tt> algorithm. In its current interface in RooFit, <tt>TFoam</tt> cannot
handle problems yet with discrete observables or conditional observables. For those problems
the original <tt>RooAcceptReject</tt> generator is still used.

<p>The choice of MC sampling algorithm can be steered through class <tt>RooNumGenConfig</tt>, which
is similar in style and structure, to <tt>RooNumIntConfig</tt> which configures the choice of
numeric integration algorithm.

<p>A new tutorial macro <tt>rf902_numgenconfig.C</tt> has been added to <tt>$ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit</tt>
to illustrate the use of the steering.

<p>A macro that demonstrates of the power of these newly interface numeric algorithms is provided at the
end of the RooFit section of the release notes.

<h4>Optional persistent caching of numeric integrals</h4>

<p>For p.d.f.s with numeric integrals that remain difficult or very time consuming,
a new persistent caching technique is now available that allows to precalculate
these integrals and store their values for future use. This technique works transparently
for any p.d.f. stored in a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt>.

<p>One can store numeric integral values for problems with zero, one or two floating parameters.
In the first case, the value is simply stored. In cases with one or two floating parameters
a grid (histogram) of integral values is stored, which are interpolated to return integral
values for each value of the parameters.

<p>A new tutorial macro <tt>rf903_numintcache.C</tt> has been added to <tt>$ROOTSYS/tutorials/roofit</tt>
to illustrate the use of this feature.


<h4>Representation of function and p.d.f. derivatives</h4>

<p>A new class has been added that can represent the derivative of any p.d.f or function w.r.t. any
parameter or observable. To construct e.g. a first order derivative of a Gaussian p.d.f, do
<pre>
    RooAbsReal* dgdx = gauss.derivative(x,1) ; 
</pre>
<p>A more complete example is available in the new tutorial macro <tt>rf111_derivatives.C</tt>
<br><br>
   <img src="roofit_524_derivatives.gif" alt="Graphics Output of macro rf111_derivatives">
<br><br>



<h4>Improved handling of chi-squared fits</h4>

<p>Chi-squared fits can now be performed through the same style of interface as likelihood fits,
through the newly added method <tt>RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataHist&,...)</tt>.

<p>Functions that can be fitted with chi-squared minimization are any <tt>RooAbsReal</tt> based function
as well as <tt>RooAbsPdf</tt> based p.d.f.s. In case of non-extended p.d.f.s the probability density
calculated by the p.d.f. is multiplied with the number of events in the histogram to adjust
the scale of the function. In case of extended p.d.f.s, the adjustment is made with the expected
number of events, rather than the observed number of events.

Tutorial macro <tt>rf602_chi2fit.C</tt> has been updated to use this new interface.


<h4>Chi-squared fits to X-Y datasets now possible</h4>

<p>In addition to the ability to perform chi-squared fits to histograms it is now also possible
to perform chi-squared fits to unbinned datasets containing a series of X and Y values
with associated errors on Y and optionally on X.

<p>These 'X-Y' chi-squared fits are interfaced through newly added method 
<tt>RooAbsReal::chi2FitTo(const RooDataSet&,...)</tt>. By default the event weight is
interpreted as the 'Y' value, but an <tt>YVar()</tt> argument can designate any other
dataset column as Y value. If X errors are defined, one can choose to integrate the fitted
function over the range of the X errors, rather than taking the central value by adding
an <tt>Integrate(true)</tt> argument to <tt>chi2FitTo()</tt>

<p>Two new arguments, <tt>StoreError(const RooArgSet&)</tt> and <tt>StoreAsymError(const RooArgSet&)</tt> 
have been added to the <tt>RooDataSet</tt> constructor to simplify the process of storing the errors
of X and Y variables along with their values in a dataset.

<p>The newly added tutorial macro <tt>rf609_xychi2fit.C</tt> illustrates the use of all this
new functionality.

<h4>Uniform interface for creation of (profile likelihoods) and chi-squared from p.d.f.s</h4>

<p>It is now recommended to use the method <tt>RooAbsPdf::createNLL(RooAbsData&,...)</tt> to
create a likelihood from a p.d.f and a dataset rather than constructing a <tt>RooNLLVar</tt>
object directly. This is because part of the likelihood construction functionality such a using
multiple <tt>Range()</tt>s, or the inclusion for constraint terms are only available through
<tt>createNLL()</tt>.

<p>To promote the consistency of this interface, a similar method <tt>RooAbsReal::createChi2()</tt>
has been added to construct chi-squared functions of a dataset and a function or p.d.f.

<p>Along the same lines, it is recommended to use <tt>RooAbsReal::createProfile()</tt> rather
than constructing a <tt>RooProfileLL</tt> object directly as the former will efficiently
recast a profile of a profile into a single profile object.

<h4>Multivariate Gaussian modeling of parameters estimates from a fit</h4>

<p>You can now construct a multivariate Gaussian p.d.f on the parameters of a model that 
represents the result of a fit, from any <tt>RooFitResult</tt> object.
<pre>
   RooAbsPdf* paramPdf = fitresult->createHessePdf(RooArgSet(a,b)) ;
</pre>
<p>The returned object is an instance of the newly added class <tt>RooMultiVarGaussian</tt>, that can
model correlated Gaussian distributions in an arbitrary number of dimensions, given a 
vector of mean values and a covariance matrix. Class <tt>RooMultivarGaussian</tt> implements analytical
integration as well as analytical partial integrals over the first 31 dimensions (if you have
that many) and implements in effect internal generation strategy for its observables

<p>A new tutorial macro <tt>rf608_fitresultaspdf.C</tt> has been added to illustrate the use MV Gaussians constructed from a <tt>RooFitResult</tt>

<h4>Improved functionality of RooFFTConvPdf</h4>

<p>The FFT convolution operator p.d.f. class <tt>RooFFTConvPdf</tt> has been substantially upgraded
for improved performance has several new options

<ul>
<li>For the overflow buffering, which aims to reduce cylical spillover from the FFT convolution, 
a choice of three algorithms is now provided:
<ol>
<li> Extend the p.d.f. somewhat beyond its original domain (the new default)
<li> Fill the buffer 50/50 with the value of the p.d.f at the upper/lower bound of the convolution observable (the previous default)
<li> Mirror the p.d.f. over the boundary
</ol>

The new default algorithm provides a more sensible result for p.d.f.s with significant
spillover issues, provided that the p.d.f. can be continuated beyond its original domain.<br><br>

<li>Convolution in non-observables is also explicitly supported now. One can e.g. construct a p.d.f 
of the form G(x) = Int[dy] ( F(x,y) (*) H(y) ). A new tutorial macro <tt>rf211_paramconv</tt> illustrates 
how such convolutions can be constructed<br><br>

<li>It is now also possible to express FFT convolutions in terms of other observables than the
convolution observable itself. A common occurrence of that situation is a (circular) convolution a polar
angle theta, for a p.d.f. that is ultimately expressed in terms of cos(theta). 
A new tutorial macro <tt>rf210_angularconv</tt> illustrates how to convolutions of angular observable
with or without an optional cosine transformation for the final observable.
</ul>


<br><br>

<br><br>



<h4>Option for improved calculation of errors in weighted likelihood fits</h4>

A new option <tt>SumW2Error()</tt> has been added to <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> that will
perform an improved error calculation for weighted unbinned likelihood fits. In their unmodified
form, an ML fit to a weighted dataset will correctly estimate the parameters, but the errors will
scale with the sum of the weights, rather than the number of the events in the dataset (i.e.
if you double all event weights, all parameter errors will go down with sqrt(2)). In chi-squared
fits event weights can processed correctly by using both the sum of the weights and the 
sum of the weights-squared for each bin. The newly added option <tt>SumW2Error()</tt> implements a similar
strategy for (unbinned) weighted ML fits by applying a correction to the covariance matrix
as follows
<pre>
   V' = V C-1 V
</pre>
where <tt>V</tt> is the covariance matrix from the fit to weighted data, and <tt>C-1</tt> is the inverse of the
covariance matrix calculated from a similar likelihood that constructed with the event weights applied squared

<h4>Redesign of RooFit dataset class structure</h4>

The original class structure of RooFit featured an abstract dataset
class <tt>RooAbsData</tt>.  Inheriting from that was a single class
<tt>RooTreeData</tt>, which implemented datasets with a ROOT
<tt>TTree</tt>-based storage implementation, and inheriting from that
two classes <tt>RooDataSet</tt> , representing unbinned data, and
<tt>RooDataHist</tt>, representing binned data. A main problem with
this structure was that the implementation of the storage technology
(<tt>TTree</tt>) and the data representation (binned vs unbinned) were
intertwined. 
<br><br>
Starting with version 3.00, the class structure has been
rearranged: Now classes <tt>RooDataSet</tt> and <tt>RooDataHist</tt> inherit directly
from class <tt>RooAbsData</tt>, and class <tt>RooAbsData</tt> now owns an object that
inherits from <tt>RooAbsDataStore</tt> that implements the storage of the
data. This new class structure allows multiple data storage implementations to
be applied efficiently to both <tt>RooDataSet</tt> and <tt>RooDataHist</tt>
At present a single implementation of <tt>RooAbsDataStore</tt> exists,
class <tt>RooTreeDataStore</tt>, that contains the storage implementation
formerly implement in class <tt>RooTreeData</tt>. Methods in class <tt>RooTreeData</tt>
that were not specific to the storage technology have been moved to
class <tt>RooAbsData</tt>.
<br><br>
If your user code only uses the classes <tt>RooDataSet</tt>,<tt>RooDataHist</tt> and <tt>RooAbsData</tt>
nothing will change: Existing <tt>RooDataSet</tt>s and <tt>RooDataHist</tt>s
(that inherit from <tt>RooTreeData</tt>) can be read in <i>without problems</i> in
RooFit 3.00 and will be converted on the fly to the new dataset structure
in memory.
<br><br>
<i>User code that explicitly uses <tt>RooTreeData</tt> pointers should
be changed to <tt>RooAbsData</tt> pointers</i>. This change should be transparent
for all uses, with the exception of the <tt>RooTreeData::tree()</tt> method. 
Explicit access to tree implementation can still be obtained
through the <tt>RooTreeDataStore::tree()</tt> method. (A pointer to the datastore
can be obtained through the <tt>RooAbsData::store()</tt> method.)
Note that in future releases it is no longer guaranteed that all datasets are implemented
with a plain <tt>TTree</tt> implementation, so any user code that uses the tree
implementation directly should implement checks that the implementation
is indeed tree-based (<tt>data->store()->InheritsFrom(RooTreeDataStore::Class())==true)</tt>).
<br><br>
In future release additional implementations of <tt>RooAbsDataStore</tt> will
be provided that will support new dataset functionality such as the
ability to construct 'joint' dataset from two input datasets without
the need to copy the input data and 'filtered' datasets that represent
a reduced view (in dimensions or by selecting events) of a dataset
without the need to copy content.


<h4>Various workspace improvements</h4>

A number of smaller and larger improvements has been made to the <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> class.

<ul>
<li><p><b>Direct interactive access to contents from CINT</b> - 
One can now directly access the contents of any <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> 
on the ROOT commandline through CINT if the <tt>RooWorkspace::exportToCint()</tt> call is made. 
In CINT, all workspace objects will appear as correctly typed references to workspace objects in
a C++ namespace with the same name as the <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> object. 

<p>Given e.g. a workspace <tt>w</tt>, with a Gaussian p.d.f <tt>gauss</tt> in terms of variables 
<tt>x,m,s</tt> one can now do
<pre>
   RooWorkspace w("w",true) ; // workspace with CINT interface activated
   // ... fill workspace with RooGaussian gauss(x,m,s) ...
   RooPlot* frame = w::x.frame() ;
   w::gauss.plotOn(frame) ;
</pre>  
to access the workspace contents. Each reference has the correct type, e.g. <tt>w::gauss</tt> is
a <tt>RooGaussian&</tt>. If a workspace is deleted from memory, the corresponding CINT namespace
is removed as well. <i>Note that this feature is strictly available in interpreted C++ only</i>

<p>A new tutorial macro has been added to illustrate this functionality in more detail: <tt>rf509_wsinteractive.C</tt>.<br><br>

<li><p><b>writeToFile</b> -- A new utility method <tt>RooWorkspace::writeToFile()</tt> has been added
to simplify the process of saving a workspace to file<br><br>

<li><p><b>Named sets and parameter snapshots</b> -- It is now possible to define and retrieve 
named <tt>RooArgSet</tt>s of objects that live in the workspace through methods 
<tt>defineSet()</tt> and <tt>set()</tt>.

<p>While named sets merely group objects logically, methods <tt>loadSnapshot</tt> and 
<tt>saveSnapshot</tt> allow to make copies of the values, errors and 'constant' status of 
sets of variable objects that live in the workspace. 

<p>A newly added tutorial macro <tt>rf510_namedsets.C</tt> illustrates the functionality of both
of these features.<br><br>

<li><b>Improved printing of contents</b> -- Many operator p.d.f. and function components now show
a more intuitive natural representation of their contents (these changes are mostly in the
respective p.d.f.s, but are most relevant in the context of a workspace).<br><br> 

</ul>


<h4>New object factory interface to workspace to facilitate script driven model definition</h4>

<p>A object factory has been added to RooFit to simplify the proces of creating p.d.f. 
and function expressions consisting of multiple objects. The factory has two goals:
the first is to provide a back-end for higher level factories and tools to process
the creation of objects. The second is to provide a simple end-user language to
populate a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> with function and p.d.f. objects. 

<p>For the latter purpose the object creation language is executed through the <tt>factory()</tt> method
of a workspace object. 

<pre>
   RooWorkspace w("w") ;
   RooAbsArg* arg = w.factory("expression_goes_here") ;
</pre>

<i>Basic Syntax</i><br>
The rules at its simplest level are as follows

<ul>
<li> Expressions with square brackets create variables (discrete and continuous)
<pre>
    "m[-10,10]"    - Creates a RooRealVar named 'm' with range [-10,10]
    "m[5,-10,10]"  - Idem, but with initial value 5
    "m[5]"         - Creates a constant RooRealVar with name 'm' and value 5.

    "tagCat[Lep,Kao,NT1,NT2]" -- Creates a RooCategory with name tagCat and labeled states Lep,Kao,NT1,NT2
    "b0flav[B0=1,B0bar=-1]"   -- Creates a RooCategory with name b0flav and states B0 and B0bar with explicit index assignments
</pre>



<li> Expressions with parentheses create <tt>RooAbsArg</tt> function objects of any type
<pre>
    "RooGaussian::g(x,m,s)"  -- Create a RooGaussian named g with variables x,m,s
                                This expression maps 1-1 to a createArg() call

    "Gaussian::g(x,m,s)"     -- Idem. The 'Roo' prefix on any class may be omitted
                                
    "Gaussian(x,m,s)"        -- Create a RooGaussian with an automatically assigned name with variables x,m,s

</pre>

<li> Expressions with curly brackets creates <tt>RooArgSet</tt>s or <tt>RooArgList</tt>s <tt>"{x,y,z}"</tt>
</ul>

<i>Compound expressions</i><br>

<p>The real power of this language is that all these expressions may be nested to result in a compact
and readable expression that creates an entire p.d.f. and its components

<pre>
   "Gaussian::g(x[-10,10],m[-10,10],3)"  
</pre>

<p>Creates a <tt>RooGaussian</tt> named 'g', its observables 'x' with range [-10,10], 
its parameter 'm' with range [-10,10]' and a constant width of 3.

<pre>
   "SUM::model( f[0.5,0,1] * Gaussian( x[-10,10], m[0], 3] ),
                             Chebychev( x, {a0[0.1],a1[0.2],a2[-0.3]}))"
</pre>

<p>Create a <tt>RooAddPdf</tt> model of a <tt>RooGaussian</tt> and a <tt>RooChebychev</tt> (which
are implicitly named <tt>model_0</tt> and <tt>model_1</tt>), its observable <tt>x</tt> and its 
parameters <tt>m,a0,a1,a2,Nsig</tt> and <tt>Nbkg</tt>

<p>Note that each object may be created only once (with [] or () brackets) but may be referenced multiple
times in the expression by just giving the name.  Here is a much more complicated example:

<pre>
  "PROD::sig(BMixDecay::sig_t( dt[-20,20], mixState[mixed=1,unmix=-1], tagFlav[B0=1,B0bar=-1],
                                             tau[1.54], dm[0.472], w[0.05], dw[0],
                                             AddModel({GaussModel(dt,biasC[-10,10],sigmaC[0.1,3],dterr[0.01,0.2]),
                                                       GaussModel(dt,0,sigmaT[3,10]),
                                                       GaussModel(dt,0,20)},{fracC[0,1],fracT[0,1]}),
                                             DoubleSided ),
             Gaussian::sig_m( mes[5.20,5.30], mB0[5.20,5.30], sigmB0[0.01,0.05] )"
</pre>

<p>This create a double-sided Bmixing decay p.d.f. with observables <tt>dt</tt>,
per-event error <tt>dterr</tt> and all its parameters, convoluted with a triple
gaussian resolution model and multiplied with a Gaussian p.d.f. in the
energy substituted mass. (In plain RooFit this would have required at
least 23 lines of code).

<p>A series of three new tutorial macros has been added to illustrate the
various features of the object factory

<ul>
<li><tt>rf511_wsfactory_basic.C</tt> - Basic factory concepts
<li><tt>rf512_wsfactory_oper.C</tt> - Using operator p.d.f.s in the factory
<li><tt>rf513_wsfactory_tools.C</tt> - Advanced example using interfaced high level tools
</ul>

<p>A formal transaction model is used to commit composite objects into
the workspace. If an error is detected in the expression, no objects
will be committed to the workspace, thus leaving no 'partial builds'.

<h4> Compact demo of several new major features</h4>

The macro below demonstrates in a couple of lines a number of major new features in RooFit 3.00: Use of
<ul>
<li> workspace factory to quickly create and store (compiled) models
<li> workspace CINT interface to easily access contents in a typesafe way
<li> new adaptive ND numeric integration technique to normalize arbitrary p.d.f. in fast 
     and reliable way
<li> new adapative TFoam sampling technique to efficiently generate toy MC data from strongly
     peaked datasets
<li> parallel processing in likelihood construction and use of profile likelihood operator
     to represent profile likelihoods as regular RooFit functions
</ul>

<pre>

    <b>// Construct compiled 2-D model that requires numeric integration for normalization</b>

<h4>Miscellaneous small improvements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Utility function <tt>bindFunction()</tt> and <tt>bindPdf</tt> that can bind
    external C++ functions as RooFit functions or p.d.f.s now can also take
    <tt>ROOT::Math::Functor</tt> objects as input arguments, which allows the
    binding of function methods of classes.<br><br>

<li>By default datasets are no cloned for fit operations to save time and memory.
    This change in procedure should save some time and memory, especially in toy MC
    studies where the overhead in setting up the likelihood can dominate the total
    time spent in fitting. The data cloning behavior of <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt>
    and <tt>RooAbsPdf::createNLL()</tt> can be explicitly set through the <tt>CloneData()</tt> 
    named argument<br><br>

<li> It is now possible to construct a <tt>RooSimultaneous</tt> p.d.f. from other
     <tt>RooSimultaneous</tt> p.d.f.s, provided the constructor form is used that takes
     all input p.d.f.s. In this constructor simultaneous-of-simultaneous p.d.f.s are automatically
     recast to an equivalent top-level simultaneous p.d.f
     Sim of sim now possible<br><br>

<li> Several improvements were made in the internal handling of datasets that
     will speedup certain data intensive operations<br><br>

<h4>TestStatistic interface and implementations</h4>
<p>We added a new interface class called <tt>TestStatistic</tt>. It defines the
method <tt>Evaluate(data, parameterPoint)</tt>, which returns a double.  This
class can be used in conjunction with the <tt>ToyMCSampler</tt> class to generate
sampling distributions for a user-defined test statistic.  </p>
<p>The following concrete implementations of the <tt>TestStatistic</tt> interface
are currently available</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>ProfileLikelihoodTestStat</tt>Returns the log of profile
likelihood ratio.  Generally a powerful test statistic. </li>
<li><tt>NumEventsTestStat</tt>Returns the number of events in the
dataset.  Useful for number counting experiments.</li>
<li><tt>DebuggingTestStat</tt> Simply returns a uniform random number
between 0,1.  Useful for debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h4>SamplingDistribution and the TestStatSampler interface and
implementations</h4>
<p>We introduced a ``result'' or data model class called
<tt>SamplingDistribution</tt>, which holds the sampling distribution of an
arbitrary real valued test statistic.  The class also can return the
inverse of the cumulative distribution function (with or without
interpolation).  </p>
<p>We introduced an interface for any tool that can produce a
<tt>SamplingDistribution</tt>, called <tt>TestStatSampler</tt>.  The interface is
essentially GetSamplingDistribution(parameterPoint) which returns a
SamplingDistribution based on a given probability density function.  We
foresee a few versions of this tool based on toy Monte Carlo, importance
sampling, Fourier transforms, etc.  The following concrete implementation
of the TestStatSampler interface are currently available</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>ToyMCSampler</tt>Uses a Toy Monte Carlo approach to build the
sampling distribution.  The pdf's generate method to generate is used to
generate toy data, and then the test statistic is evaluated at the
requested parameter point. </li>
<li><tt>DebuggingSampler</tt> Simply returns a uniform distribution
between 0,1.  Useful for debugging.</li>
</ul>


<h4>NeymanConstruction and FeldmanCousins</h4>
<p>A flexible framework for the Neyman Construction was added in this
release. The NeymanConstruction is a concrete implementation of the
IntervalCalculator interface, but it needs several
additional components to be specified before use. The design
factorizes the choice of the parameter points to be tested, the choice of
the test statistic, and the generation of sampling distribution into
separate parts (described above).  Finally, the <tt>NeymanConstruction</tt> class
is simply in charge of using these parts (strategies) and constructing
the confidence belt and confidence intervals.  The <tt>ConfidenceBelt</tt> class
is still under development, but the current version works fine for
producing <tt>ConfidenceIntervals</tt>.  We are also working to make this class
work with parallelization approaches, which is not yet complete.</p>
<p>The <tt>FeldmanCousins</tt> class is a separate concrete implementation of the
<tt>IntervalCalculator</tt> interface.  It uses the <tt>NeymanConstruction</tt> internally,
and enforces specific choices of the test statistic and ordering
principle to realize the Unified intervals described by Feldman and
Cousins in their paper Phys.Rev.D57:3873-3889,1998.
</p>
<p>
In an extension to the technique discussed in Feldman and Cousins paper, 
the <tt>FeldmanCousins</tt> class also performs a "profile construction" if their are nuisance parameters.
In this case, the parameters of interest are scanned in a regular grid.  For each point in the grid
the calculator finds the best fit value of the nuisance parameters (given the data).  The construction
is then only performed in this subspace of the parameters.  As a result, the number of points in the 
construction only scales in the number of parameters of interest, not in the number of nuisance parameters.
</p>

<h4>Markov Chain Monte Carlo Interval</h4>
<p>A flexible framework for Markov Chain Monte Carlo  was added in this
release. The <tt>MCMCCalculator</tt> is a concrete implementation of the
<tt>IntervalCalculator</tt> interface.  To use it one needs to specify the <tt>ProposalFunction</tt>. 
There is a base class for ProposalFunctions and one concrete implementation: <tt>UniformProposal</tt>. 
Support for other proposal functions will be added in the next release.
The <tt>MCMCCalculator</tt> scans the space of the parameters of interest and nuisance parameters and
produces a Bayesian posterior.  In this version, the prior must be added to the model initially,
otherwise a flat prior is assumed.  The <tt>MCMCCalculator</tt> returns an <tt>MCMCInterval</tt>, which produces
the smallest interval by taking a contour of the posterior.  This first version only supports 
1,2, and 3 dimensional intervals, but will be generalized in the next release.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the MCMC implementation in RooStats, one can export their model and dataset into a workspace,
 and then use the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit (BAT) for the MCMC.  There is a wrapper available.
</p>

<h4>Redesigned SPlot class</h4>
<p>The RooStats SPlot implementation works with any RooAbsPdf.  The class has been redesigned for more 
convenient use.  It also adds some helper functions to check that the sum of sWeights over species is 1 for each event and 
the sum over events for a given species equals the yield for that species.
</p>

<h4>Plotting classes</h4>
<p>We have added new plotting classes: <tt>SamplingDistPlot</tt> and <tt>LikelihoodIntervalPlot</tt>.  
In 1-d LikelihoodIntervalPlot shows the profile likelihood ratio and the upper/lower limits 
of the interval for the parameter of interest.  In 2-d, the LikelihoodIntervalPlot shows
the contour of the profile likelihood ratio for the parameters of interest.
</p>



<h4>Bernstein Correction</h4>
<p>
BernsteinCorrection is a utility in RooStats to augment a nominal PDF
with a polynomial 
correction term.  This is useful for incorporating systematic variations
to the nominal PDF.  
The Bernstein basis polynomails are particularly appropriate because they
are positive definite. 
</p>
<p>
This tool was inspired by the work of Glen Cowan together with Stephan
Horner, Sascha Caron, 
Eilam Gross, and others.  
The initial implementation is independent work.  The major step forward
in the approach was 
to provide a well defined algorithm that specifies the order of
polynomial to be included 
in the correction.  This is an emperical algorithm, so in addition to the
nominal model it 
needs either a real data set or a simulated one.  In the early work, the
nominal model was taken
to be a histogram from Monte Carlo simulations, but in this
implementation it is generalized to an
arbitrary PDF (which includes a RooHistPdf).  The algorithm basically
consists of a 
hypothesis test of an nth-order correction (null) against a n+1-th order
correction (alternate). 
The quantity q = -2 log LR is used to determine whether the n+1-th order
correction is a major 
improvement to the n-th order correction.  The distribution of q is
expected to be roughly 
\chi^2 with one degree of freedom if the n-th order correction is a good
model for the data. 
 Thus, one only moves to the n+1-th order correction of q is relatively
large.  The chance that 
one moves from the n-th to the n+1-th order correction when the n-th
order correction 
(eg. a type 1 error) is sufficient is given by the Prob(\chi^2_1 >
threshold).  The constructor 
of this class allows you to directly set this tolerance (in terms of
probability that the n+1-th
 term is added unnecessarily).
</p>

<h4>HybridCalculator</h4>
<p> Add as a new test statistics the profile likelihood ratio.  Will be redesigned to use TestStatSampler and TestStatistic in next release.
