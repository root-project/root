<h3>RooFit</h3>

 <h4>RooWorkspace</h4>

      New feature that allows to persist source code of RooFit classes that
      are not in ROOT distribution inside a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> to facilitate sharing
      of custom code with others. To import code of custom classes call
<pre>
         RooWorkspace::importClassCode()
</pre>
      after importing the objects themselves into the workspace. For all classes
      that are compiled with ACliC <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> can automatically find the source
      code using the ROOT <tt>TClass</tt> interface. For custom classes that are compiled
      externally and loaded into ROOT as shared library it might be necessary to
      provide the location of the source files manually using the static RooWorkspace
      member functions <tt>addClassDeclImportDir()</tt> and <tt>addClassImplImportDir()</tt>.<br><br>
      
      When a <tt>TFile</tt> with a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> containing source code is opened in a ROOT
      session that does not have the class code already loaded for the classes
      contained in the workspace, the code in the workspace is written to file,
      compiled and loaded into the ROOT session on the fly.<br><br>

      The code repository of <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> is designed to handle classes that
      have either their own implementation and header file, or are part of a group
      of classes that share a common header and implementation file. More complicated
      structuring of source code into files is not supported. 

  <h4>Parameterized ranges</h4>

      It is now possible to use <tt>RooAbsReal</tt> derived functions as range definition for variables
      to construct ranges that vary as function of another variable. For example
<pre>
         RooRealVar x("x","x",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] 
         RooRealVar y("y","y",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] 
   
         RooFormulaVar x_lo("x_lo","y-20",y) ;      
         RooFormulaVar x_hi("x_hi","sin(y)*5",y) ;      
         x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ;  // Change x to have variable range depending on y
</pre>  
      It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way
<pre>
         x.setRange("signalRegion",x_lo,x_hi) ;
</pre>
      There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges
      that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables 
      x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z
      and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z)
      over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into
      account. A definition of a range 'R' on the other hand where the bounds of x depend on y <i>and</i>
      the bounds of y depend on x is not allowed, and an error message will be printed to complain about
      the ambiguity of the problem definition. Integrals over non-rectangular regions are created the
      same way as integrals over rectangular regions using the <tt>RooAbsReal::createIntegral()</tt> function, the
      chosen mode of operation depends on the shape of the requestion integration range.<br><br>

      Note that in general integration over non (hyper)rectangular regions will be more computationally
      intensive as only a subset of the observables can be integrated analytically (all of those that do not
      have parameterized ranges plus those that have parameterized ranges but are not involved in the
      parameterization of others (e.g. x and y in the example above)

  <h4>Cumulative distribution functions</h4>

      You can create an <tt>RooAbsReal</tt> derived object representing the <i>cumulative distribution function</i>
      (=<tt>Int[-inf : x] F(x') dx'</tt>) of any <tt>RooAbsPdf</tt> using the new <tt>RooAbsPdf::createCdf</tt> function.
<pre>
         RooAbsReal* myCdf = myPdf->createCdf(observables,normobs) ;
</pre>
      where <tt>observables</tt> is the <tt>RooArgSet</tt> with the observables for which to create the CDF and <tt>normobs</tt>
      is the (optional) set of observables over which the p.d.f should be normalized <i>in addition</i>
      to <tt>observables</tt>. The <tt>createCdf()</tt> function can create one-dimensional as well as higher dimensional c.d.f.s.

 <h4>Constraints management</h4>

      New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.
      The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions
      and can thus be modeled by <tt>RooAbsPdf</tt> classes (e.g. a <tt>RooGaussian</tt> for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).
      There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying
      the constraint p.d.f.s with your 'master' p.d.f. or you specify them externally in each operation. The
      first mode of operation keeps all information in your master p.d.f and may make the logistics of non-trivial
      fitting problems easier. It works as follows: first you define your regular p.d.f, then you define your
      constraint p.d.f and you multiply them with <tt>RooProdPdf</tt>.
<pre>
        // Construct constraint
        RooGaussian fconstraint("fconstraint","fconstraint",f,RooConst(0.8),RooConst(0.1)) ;

        // Multiply constraint with p.d.f
        RooProdPdf pdfc("pdfc","p.d.f with constraint",RooArgSet(p.d.f,fconstraint)) ;
</pre>
      If your top level p.d.f is already a <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> it also fine to multiply all terms together in one go.
      Constraints do not need to be specified a the top-level <tt>RooProdPdf</tt>, constraint p.d.f.s in any component
      <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> lower in the expression tree are used as well. Constraints are <i>not</i> used by default in fitting
      if present in a p.d.f. To activate the use of a constraint in fitting, use the <tt>Constrain()</tt> argument in <tt>fitTo()</tt>
<pre>
        // Fit with internal constraint
        RooFitResult* r2 = pdfc.fitTo(*d,Constrain(f)) ;
</pre> 
      This will instruct <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> to included any constraint p.d.f on parameter f in the
      definition of the likelihood. It is possible to add multiple constraints on the same parameter
      to the 'master' p.d.f. If so, all constraints on a given parameter will be added to the likelihood.<br><br>

      The <tt>RooMCStudy</tt> class has been extended to accept the <tt>Constrain()</tt> argument as well in its constructor.
      If specified it will do two things: 1) it will pass the constrain argument to the fitting pass of
      the toy study and 2) it will modify the generation step into a two-step procedure: for each toy
      in the study it will first sample a value of each constrained parameter from the joint constraints
      p.d.f and it will then generate the observables for that experiment with the thus obtained parameter values.
      In this mode of operation the parameter values for each toy may thus be different. The actual parameter
      for each toy can be obtained with the newly added <tt>RooMCStudy::genParDataSet()</tt> member function. The calculation
      of the pull values for each parameter has been modified accordingly.<br><br>

      Alternatively, it is possible to specify constraints to both <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> and the <tt>RooMCStudy</tt> constructor
      using the <tt>ExternalConstraint()</tt> named argument to supply constraint p.d.f.s that are not part of the 'master'
      p.d.f but rather an ad-hoc supplied external constraint. The argument supplied to <tt>ExternalConstraint()</tt> should
      be (a set of) constraint p.d.f(s), rather than (a set of) parameters for which internal constraint p.d.f.s should
      be picked up.

 <h4>New PDF error handling structure</h4>

      New infrastructure has been put into place to propagate and process p.d.f evaluation errors during fitting.
      Previously evaluation errors were marked with a zero p.d.f value and propagated as a special condition
      in <tt>RooAddPdf</tt>, <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> etc to result in a zero top-level p.d.f value that was caught by the RooFit minuit
      interface as a special condition. Summary information on the value of the parameters and the observables
      was printed for the first 10 occurrences of such conditions. Now, each p.d.f component that generates an error
      in its evaluation logs the error into a separate facility during fitting and the the RooFit minuit interface
      polls this error logging facility for problems. This allows much more detailed and accurate warning messages
      during the minimization phase. The level of verbosity of this new error facility can be controlled with
      a new <tt>PrintEvalErrors(Int_t code)</tt> argument to <tt>fitTo()</tt>. With code of -1, no errors are printed at all. With a
      code of zero, one line is printed for each p.d.f component with problems summarizing the number of times
      problems occured during the likelihood evaluation. A code greater than zero will generate even more detail and
      print the details of each evaluation error as provided by the p.d.f (zero value, not-a-number, normalization zero etc..)
      and show the observable values at which this error occurred. At most N detailed messages per p.d.f component
      are shown where N is the integral value of the 'code' argument.

  <h4> Other new features</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The <tt>RooAddPdf</tt> constructor has been augmented with an additional boolean argument that allows to
      interpret the supplied fraction parameters as recursive fractions rather than plain fractions.
      If activated, an example <tt>RooAddPdf</tt> with three input p.d.f. A,B,C and two fractions fA and fB will
      result in the expression<br><br>
 
        <tt>fA*A + (1-fA)(fB*B + 1-fB*C)</tt>  rather than <tt>fA*A + fB*B + (1-fA-fB)*C</tt><br><br>

      Recursive fraction have the advantage that all fraction can be defined to be in the range [0-1]
      without resulting in configuration where the sum of all fractions exceeds 1.<br><br>
     
  <li>The low-level object printing interface <tt>printToStream()</tt> has been deprecated in favor of a new
      <tt>printStream()</tt> method which allows much greater control over the information printed. <br><br>

  <li>Data weighted projections of p.d.fs using the <tt>ProjWData()</tt> argument in <tt>RooAbsPdf::plotOn()</tt> are now calculated
      with a new classes that derives from <tt>RooAbsOptTestStatistic</tt> and can thus implement the same evaluation
      optimizations as are done for <tt>RooNLLVar</tt> and <tt>RooChi2Var</tt>. Specifically it is now possible to calculate projections
      involving <tt>ProjWData()</tt> in parallel on multi-core hosts by adding the <tt>NumCPU(Int_t)</tt> argument to <tt>plotOn()</tt>.
