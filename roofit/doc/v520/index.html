 <h4>Update of class documentation</h4>
  
      The documentation in the code itself that is extracted by <tt>THtml</tt> to construct
      the online class documentation has been updated for all classes. Now <i>all</i> classes
      have (again) a short class description, as well as a (short) description of each member function
      and most data members. An update to the users manual is foreseen shortly after the 5.20
      release.

 <h4>RooWorkspace</h4>

      A new feature has been added that allows to persist source code of RooFit classes that
      are not in ROOT distribution inside a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> to facilitate sharing
      of custom code with others. To import code of custom classes call
<pre>
         RooWorkspace::importClassCode()
</pre>
      after importing the objects themselves into the workspace. For all classes
      that are compiled with ACliC <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> can automatically find the source
      code using the ROOT <tt>TClass</tt> interface. For custom classes that are compiled
      externally and loaded into ROOT as shared library it might be necessary to
      provide the location of the source files manually using the static RooWorkspace
      member functions <tt>addClassDeclImportDir()</tt> and <tt>addClassImplImportDir()</tt>.<br><br>
      
      When a <tt>TFile</tt> with a <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> containing source code is opened in a ROOT
      session that does not have the class code already loaded for the classes
      contained in the workspace, the code in the workspace is written to file,
      compiled and loaded into the ROOT session on the fly.<br><br>

      The code repository of <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> is designed to handle classes that
      have either their own implementation and header file, or are part of a group
      of classes that share a common header and implementation file. More complicated
      structuring of source code into files is not supported. <br><br>
  
      Also new accessors have been added for discrete-valued functions <tt>catfunc()</tt>
      and stored category functions are now also printed under their own heading in <tt>Print()</tt>    

  <h4>Parameterized ranges</h4>

      It is now possible to use <tt>RooAbsReal</tt> derived functions as range definition for variables
      to construct ranges that vary as function of another variable. For example
<pre>
         RooRealVar x("x","x",-10,10) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] 
         RooRealVar y("y","y",0,20) ; // variable with fixed range [-10,10] 
   
         RooFormulaVar x_lo("x_lo","y-20",y) ;      
         RooFormulaVar x_hi("x_hi","sin(y)*5",y) ;      
         x.setRange(x_lo,x_hi) ;  // Change x to have variable range depending on y
</pre>  
      It is also possible to define parameterized named ranges in the same way
<pre>
         x.setRange("signalRegion",x_lo,x_hi) ;
</pre>
      There are no fundamental limits to the complexity of the parameterized ranges
      that can be defined as long as the problem is uniquely defined. For example, given three observables 
      x, y and z, one can define a parameterized named range 'R' of x in terms of y and of y in terms of z
      and ask to calculate the three dimensional integral of any function or p.d.f in terms of (x,y,z)
      over that range 'R' and it will be calculated correctly, taking recursive range dependencies into
      account. A definition of a range 'R' on the other hand where the bounds of x depend on y <i>and</i>
      the bounds of y depend on x is not allowed, and an error message will be printed to complain about
      the ambiguity of the problem definition. Integrals over non-rectangular regions are created the
      same way as integrals over rectangular regions using the <tt>RooAbsReal::createIntegral()</tt> function, the
      chosen mode of operation depends on the shape of the requestion integration range.<br><br>

      Note that in general integration over non (hyper)rectangular regions will be more computationally
      intensive as only a subset of the observables can be integrated analytically (all of those that do not
      have parameterized ranges plus those that have parameterized ranges but are not involved in the
      parameterization of others (e.g. x and y in the example above)

<h4>Running integrals and Cumulative distribution functions</h4>

     It is now possible to create running integrals from any <tt>RooAbsReal</tt> function and
     to create cumulative distribution functions from any <tt>RooAbsPdf</tt> using the following
     methods:
<pre>
        // Create int[xlo,x] f(x') dx' from f(x)
        RooAbsReal* runInt = func.createRunningIntegral(x) ;

        // Create int[xlo,x] f(x') dx' from p.d.f f(x) normalized over x
        RooAbsReal* cdf = pdf.createCdf(x) ;

        // Create int[xlo,x] f(x',y) dx' from p.d.f f(x,y) normalized over (x,y)
        RooAbsReal* cdf = pdf.createCdf(x,y) ;
</pre>
  
     As with the similarly styled function <tt>createIntegral</tt> running integrals and c.d.f. can be created
     over any number of observables, e.g <tt>createCdf(RooArgSet(x,y,z))</tt> will create a three-dimensional
     cumulative distribution function. C.d.f and running integrals that are calculated from p.d.fs that have
     support for analytical integration are constructed from an appropriately reconnected <tt>RooRealIntegral</tt>.
     If numeric integration is required, the c.d.f or running integral is calculated by a dedicated class
     <tt>RooRunningIntegral</tt> that precalculates results for all observable values, which is more efficient
     in most use cases. Cumulative distributions functions that are calculated numerically are handled slightly differently
     that standard running integrals: their values is constructed to converge to exactly zero at the lower bound
     and exactly 1 at the upper bound so that algorithms that make use of that property of c.d.f can do so reliably.

 <h4>Constraints management</h4>

      New tools have been added to simplify studies with fits involving (external) constraints on parameters.
      The general philosophy is that constraints on parameters can be represented as probability density functions
      and can thus be modeled by <tt>RooAbsPdf</tt> classes (e.g. a <tt>RooGaussian</tt> for a simple Gaussian constraint on a parameter).
      There are two modes of operation: you can add parameter constraints to your problem definition by multiplying
      the constraint p.d.f.s with your 'master' p.d.f. or you specify them externally in each operation. The
      first mode of operation keeps all information in your master p.d.f and may make the logistics of non-trivial
      fitting problems easier. It works as follows: first you define your regular p.d.f, then you define your
      constraint p.d.f and you multiply them with <tt>RooProdPdf</tt>.
<pre>
        // Construct constraint
        RooGaussian fconstraint("fconstraint","fconstraint",f,RooConst(0.8),RooConst(0.1)) ;

        // Multiply constraint with p.d.f
        RooProdPdf pdfc("pdfc","p.d.f with constraint",RooArgSet(p.d.f,fconstraint)) ;
</pre>
      If your top level p.d.f is already a <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> it also fine to multiply all terms together in one go.
      Constraints do not need to be specified a the top-level <tt>RooProdPdf</tt>, constraint p.d.f.s in any component
      <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> lower in the expression tree are used as well. Constraints are <i>not</i> used by default in fitting
      if present in a p.d.f. To activate the use of a constraint in fitting, use the <tt>Constrain()</tt> argument in <tt>fitTo()</tt>
<pre>
        // Fit with internal constraint
        RooFitResult* r2 = pdfc.fitTo(*d,Constrain(f)) ;
</pre> 
      This will instruct <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> to included any constraint p.d.f on parameter f in the
      definition of the likelihood. It is possible to add multiple constraints on the same parameter
      to the 'master' p.d.f. If so, all constraints on a given parameter will be added to the likelihood.<br><br>

      The <tt>RooMCStudy</tt> class has been extended to accept the <tt>Constrain()</tt> argument as well in its constructor.
      If specified it will do two things: 1) it will pass the constrain argument to the fitting pass of
      the toy study and 2) it will modify the generation step into a two-step procedure: for each toy
      in the study it will first sample a value of each constrained parameter from the joint constraints
      p.d.f and it will then generate the observables for that experiment with the thus obtained parameter values.
      In this mode of operation the parameter values for each toy may thus be different. The actual parameter
      for each toy can be obtained with the newly added <tt>RooMCStudy::genParDataSet()</tt> member function. The calculation
      of the pull values for each parameter has been modified accordingly.<br><br>

      Alternatively, it is possible to specify constraints to both <tt>RooAbsPdf::fitTo()</tt> and the <tt>RooMCStudy</tt> constructor
      using the <tt>ExternalConstraint()</tt> named argument to supply constraint p.d.f.s that are not part of the 'master'
      p.d.f but rather an ad-hoc supplied external constraint. The argument supplied to <tt>ExternalConstraint()</tt> should
      be (a set of) constraint p.d.f(s), rather than (a set of) parameters for which internal constraint p.d.f.s should
      be picked up.


<h4>New operator class <tt>RooLinearMorph</tt></h4>

    A new numeric operator class <tt>RooLinearMorph</tt> has been added that provides a continuous
    transformation between two p.d.f.s shapes in terms of a linear parameter alpha. The algorithm 
    for histograms is described in the paper by Alex Read in NUM A 425 (1999) 357-369 
    'Linear interpolation of histograms'. The implementation in <tt>RooLinearMorph</tt> is for
    continuous functions. 

<pre>
        // Observable and sampling binning to be used by RooLinearMorph ("cache")
        RooRealVar x("x","x",-20,20) ;
        x.setBins(1000,"cache") ;

        // End point shapes : a gaussian on one end, a polynomial on the other
        RooGaussian f1("f1","f1",x,RooConst(-10),RooConst(2)) ;
        RooPolynomial f2("f2","f2",x,RooArgSet(RooConst(-0.03),RooConst(-0.001))) ;

        // Interpolation parameter: rlm=f1 at alpha=0, rlm=f2 at alpha=1
        RooRealVar alpha("alpha","alpha",0,1.0) ;
        RooLinearMorph rlm("rlm","rlm",g1,g2,x,alpha) ;

        // Plot halfway shape
        alpha=0.5
        RooPlot* frame = x.frame() ;
        rlm.plotOn(frame) ;
</pre>

    In short the algorithm works as follows: for both f1(x) and f2(x), the cumulative distribution
    functions F1(x) and F2(x) are calculated. One finds takes a value 'y' of both c.d.fs and 
    determines the corresponding x values x1,x2 at which F1(x1)=F2(x2)=y. The value of the interpolated 
    p.d.f fbar(x) is then calculated as fbar(alpha*x1+(1-alpha)*x2) = f1(x1)*f2(x2) / ( alpha*f2(x2) + 
    (1-alpha)*f1(x1) ). Given that it is not easily possible to calculate the value of RooLinearMorph
    at a given value of x, the value for all values of x are calculated in one by (through a scan over y)
    and stored in a cache. NB: The range of the interpolation parameter does not need to be [0,1], it can
    be anything.


<h4>New workspace tool <tt>RooSimWSTool</tt></h4>

    A new tool to clone and customize p.d.f.s into a <tt>RooSimultaneous</tt> p.d.f has been added. This new
    tool succeeds the original <tt>RooSimPdfBuilder</tt> tool which had a similar functionality but
    has a much cleaner interface, partly thanks to its use of the <tt>RooWorkspace</tt> class for both input
    of prototype p.d.fs and output of built p.d.f.s<br><br>

    The simplest use case to to take a workspace p.d.f as prototype and 'split' a parameter of that p.d.f 
    into two specialized parameters  depending on a category in the dataset. 
     For example, given a Gaussian p.d.f <tt>G(x,m,s)</tt> we want to construct a <tt>G_a(x,m_a,s)</tt> and a <tt>G_b(x,m_b,s)</tt>
    with different mean parameters to be fit to a dataset with observables
    <tt>(x,c)</tt> where c is a category with states <tt>'a'</tt> and <tt>'b'</tt>.
    Using <tt>RooSimWSTool</tt> one can create a simultaneous p.d.f from <tt>G_a</tt> and <tt>G_b</tt>
    from <tt>G</tt> with the following command

<pre>
        RooSimWSTool wst(wspace) ;
        wst.build("G_sim","G",SplitParam("m","c")) ;
</pre>

    From this simple example one can go to builds of arbitrary complexity
    by specifying multiple <tt>SplitParam</tt> arguments on multiple parameters
    involving multiple splitting categories. Splits can also be performed
    in the product multiple categories, e.g. 

<pre>
        SplitParam("m","c,d")) ;
</pre>

 splits parameter m in the product of states of c and d. Another possibility
 is the 'constrained' split which clones the parameter for all but one state
 and insert a formula specialization in a chosen state that evaluates
 to <tt>1 - sum_i(a_i)</tt> where a_i are all other specializations. For example,
 given a category c with state "A","B","C","D" the specification

<pre>
     SplitParamConstrained("m","c","D")
</pre>

 will result in parameters <tt>m_A,m_B,m_C</tt> and a formula expression <tt>m_D</tt>
 that evaluates to (1-(m_A+m_B+m_C)). Constrained split can also be
 specified in product of categories. In that case the name of the
 remainder state follows the syntax <tt>{State1;State2}</tt> where <tt>State1</tt>
 and <tt>State2</tt> are the state names of the two spitting categories. Additional
 functionality exists to work with multiple prototype p.d.f.s simultaneously.

      
<h4>Improved infrastructure for caching p.d.f and functions</h4>

 The infrastructure that exists for caching p.d.f.s, i.e. p.d.f that precalculate their value
 for all observable values at one and cache those in a histogram that is returned as p.d.f shape
 (with optional interpolation), has been expanded. This infrastructure comprises <tt>RooAbsCached</tt>
 the base class for all caching p.d.fs, <tt>RooAbsSelfCachedPdf</tt> a base class for end-user
 caching p.d.f implementations that simply cache the result of <tt>evaluate()</tt> and <tt>RooCachedPdf</tt>
 that can wrap and cache any input p.d.f specified in its constructor.<br><br> 

 By default a p.d.f is sampled and cached in all observables in any
 given use context, with no need to specify what those are in advance.
 The internal code has also been changed such that all cache
 histograms now store pre-normalized p.d.f, which is more efficient
 than 'raw' p.d.f histograms that are explicitly post-normalized
 through integration.  Multiple different use cases (e.g. definitions
 of what are observables vs parameters) can be cached
 simultaneously. Now it is also possible to specify that p.d.f.s
 should be sampled and cached in one or more parameter dimensionsal
 <i>in addition</i> to the automatically determined set of observables.
 as well.
<br><br>
 Also a complete new line of classes with similar functionality has been added inheriting from RooAbsReal.
 These are <tt>RooAbsCachedReal</tt>,<tt>RooAbsSelfCachedReal</tt> and <tt>RooCachedReal</tt>. A newly
 added class <tt>RooHistFunc</tt> presents these shapes and is capable of handling negative entries.

 <h4>New PDF error handling structure</h4>

      New infrastructure has been put into place to propagate and process p.d.f evaluation errors during fitting.
      Previously evaluation errors were marked with a zero p.d.f value and propagated as a special condition
      in <tt>RooAddPdf</tt>, <tt>RooProdPdf</tt> etc to result in a zero top-level p.d.f value that was caught by the RooFit minuit
      interface as a special condition. Summary information on the value of the parameters and the observables
      was printed for the first 10 occurrences of such conditions. <br><br>

      Now, each p.d.f component that generates an error
      in its evaluation logs the error into a separate facility during fitting and the the RooFit minuit interface
      polls this error logging facility for problems. This allows much more detailed and accurate warning messages
      during the minimization phase. The level of verbosity of this new error facility can be controlled with
      a new 
<pre>
        PrintEvalErrors(Int_t code)
</pre>
      argument to <tt>fitTo()</tt>. <br><br>
      <ul>
      <li>With code of -1, no errors are printed at all.
      <li>With a
      code of zero, <i>one line</i> is printed for each p.d.f component with problems summarizing the number of times
      problems occured during the likelihood evaluation. 

<pre>
        [#0] WARNING:Minization -- RooFitGlue: Minimized function has error status. 
        Returning maximum FCN so far (-1e+30) to force MIGRAD to back out of this region. Error log follows
        Parameter values: m=-7.397
        RooGaussian::gx[ x=x mean=m sigma=sx ] has 3 errors
</pre>

      <li>A code greater than zero will generate even more detail and
      print the details of each evaluation error as provided by the p.d.f (zero value, not-a-number, normalization zero etc..)
      and show the observable values at which this error occurred. At most N detailed messages per p.d.f component
      are shown where N is the integral value of the 'code' argument. 

<pre>
        [#0] WARNING:Minization -- RooFitGlue: Minimized function has error status.
        Returning maximum FCN so far (-1e+30) to force MIGRAD to back out of this region. Error log follows
        Parameter values: m=-7.397
        RooGaussian::gx[ x=x mean=m sigma=sx ]
             getLogVal() top-level p.d.f evaluates to zero or negative number @ x=x=9.09989, mean=m=-7.39713, sigma=sx=0.1
             getLogVal() top-level p.d.f evaluates to zero or negative number @ x=x=6.04652, mean=m=-7.39713, sigma=sx=0.1
             getLogVal() top-level p.d.f evaluates to zero or negative number @ x=x=2.48563, mean=m=-7.39713, sigma=sx=0.1
</pre>



      </ul>
      The new-style error logging is active whenever MINUIT is operating on such a p.d.f. The default value for N is 3.
      Outside the MINUIT context the evaluation error each evualuation error will generate a separate message through
      <tt>RooMsgService</tt>

  <h4> Other new features</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>The <tt>RooAddPdf</tt> constructor has been augmented with an additional boolean argument that allows to
      interpret the supplied fraction parameters as recursive fractions rather than plain fractions.
      If activated, an example <tt>RooAddPdf</tt> with three input p.d.f. A,B,C and two fractions fA and fB will
      result in the expression<br><br>
 
        <tt>fA*A + (1-fA)(fB*B + 1-fB*C)</tt>  rather than <tt>fA*A + fB*B + (1-fA-fB)*C</tt><br><br>

      Recursive fraction have the advantage that all fraction can be defined to be in the range [0-1]
      without resulting in configuration where the sum of all fractions exceeds 1.<br><br>
     
  <li>The low-level object printing interface <tt>printToStream()</tt> has been deprecated in favor of a new
      <tt>printStream()</tt> method which allows much greater control over the information printed. 
      The printing of almost all RooFit objects has been reworked to present a more uniform look and feel.
      The standard one-line result of the high-level <tt>Print()</tt> method without option now looks like

<pre>
        // Variable
        x.Print() ;
        RooRealVar::x = 0 L(-10 - 10) 

        // Function or p.d.f
        gx.Print() ;
        RooGaussian::gx[ x=x mean=m sigma=sx ] = 1

        // Dataset
        d.Print() ;
        RooDataSet::gData[x,y] = 1000 entries

        // RooPlot
        frame.Print() ;
        framex[x] = (RooHist::h_gData,RooCurve::g_Int[y]_Norm[x,y]_Comp[g])
</pre>

      Inside class <tt>RooPlot</tt> the default name of contained curves and histograms has been 
      reworked in something more self descriptive as is shown in the above example. A usual,
      a user supplied name can always be set by supplying the <tt>Name(const char*)</tt> argument
      to <tt>plotOn()</tt>

      Verbose printing with "v" options is mostly unchanged except for <tt>RooPlot</tt>. In addition
      printing with the "s" option will show the 'old' standard printing mode, option "t" will show
      tree structure printing (only for RooAbsArg), and option "1" will invoke inline printing, i.e
      a one-line description without a trailing <tt>endl</tt>.<br><br>


  <li>Data weighted projections of p.d.fs using the <tt>ProjWData()</tt> argument in <tt>RooAbsPdf::plotOn()</tt> are now calculated
      with a new classes that derives from <tt>RooAbsOptTestStatistic</tt> and can thus implement the same evaluation
      optimizations as are done for <tt>RooNLLVar</tt> and <tt>RooChi2Var</tt>. <b>Specifically it is now possible to calculate projections
      involving <tt>ProjWData()</tt> in parallel on multi-core hosts </b>by adding the <tt>NumCPU(Int_t)</tt> argument to <tt>plotOn()</tt>.
      <br><br>

  <li> A new utility function has been added to allow cloning of entire tree expressions of
       <tt>RooAbsArg</tt> objects, such as a composite p.d.f including component p.d.fs and
       all its variables:
<pre>
       RooAbsArg* clonedTree = pdf.cloneTree() ;
</pre>
       All cloned leaf and branch nodes are owned by the returned head node of the expression.<br><br>

  <li>Assorted minor fixes
  </ul>
