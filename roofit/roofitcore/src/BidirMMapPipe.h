/** @brief BidirMMapPipe creates a bidirectional channel between the current
 * process and a child it forks.
 *
 * @author Manuel Schiller <manuel.schiller@nikhef.nl>
 * @date 2013-07-07
 *
 * This class creates a bidirectional channel between this process and a child
 * it creates with fork().
 *
 * The channel is comrised of a small shared pool of buffer memory mmapped into
 * both process spaces, and two pipes to synchronise the exchange of data. The
 * idea behind using the pipes at all is to have some primitive which we can
 * block on without having to worry about atomic operations or polling, leaving
 * these tasks to the OS. In case the anonymous mmap cannot be performed on the
 * OS the code is running on (for whatever reason), the code falls back to
 * mmapping /dev/zero, mmapping a temporary file, or (if those all fail), a
 * dynamically allocated buffer which is then transmitted through the pipe(s),
 * a slightly slower alternative (because the data is copied more often).
 *
 * The channel supports five major operations: read(), write(), flush(),
 * purge() and close(). Reading and writing may block until the required buffer
 * space is available. Writes may queue up data to be sent to the other end
 * until either enough pages are full, or the user calls flush which forces
 * any unsent buffers to be sent to the other end. flush forces any data that
 * is to be sent to be sent. purge discards any buffered data waiting to be
 * read and/or sent. Closing the channel on the child returns zero, closing it
 * on the parent returns the child's exit status.
 *
 * The class also provides operator<< and operator>> for C++-style I/O for
 * basic data types (bool, char, short, int, long, long long, float, double
 * and their unsigned counterparts). Data is transmitted binary (i.e. no
 * formatting to strings like std::cout does). There are also overloads to
 * support C-style zero terminated strings and std::string. In terms of
 * performance, the former is to be preferred.
 *
 * If the caller needs to multiplex input and output to/from several pipes, the
 * class provides the poll() method which allows to block until an event occurs
 * on any of the polled pipes.
 *
 * After the BidirMMapPipe is closed, no further operations may be performed on
 * that object, save for the destructor which may still be called.
 *
 * If the BidirMMapPipe has not properly been closed, the destructor will call
 * close. However, the exit code of the child is lost in that case.
 *
 * Closing the object causes the mmapped memory to be unmapped and the two
 * pipes to be closed. We also install an atexit handler in the process of
 * creating BidirMMapPipes. This ensures that when the current process
 * terminates, a SIGTERM signal is sent to the child processes created for all
 * unclosed pipes to avoid leaving zombie processes in the OS's process table.
 *
 * BidirMMapPipe creation, closing and destruction are thread safe. If the
 * BidirMMapPipe is used in more than one thread, the other operations have to
 * be protected with a mutex (or something similar), though.
 *
 * End of file (other end closed its pipe, or died) is indicated with the eof()
 * method, serious I/O errors set a flags (bad(), fail()), and also throw
 * exceptions. For normal read/write operations, they can be suppressed (i.e.
 * error reporting only using flags) with a constructor argument.
 *
 * Technicalities:
 * - there is a pool of mmapped pages, half the pages are allocated to the
 *   parent process, half to the child
 * - when one side has accumulated enough data (or a flush forces dirty pages
 *   out to the other end), it sends these pages to the other end by writing a
 *   byte containing the page number into the pipe
 * - the other end (which has the pages mmapped, too) reads the page number(s)
 *   and puts the corresponding pages on its busy list
 * - as the other ends reads, it frees busy pages, and eventually tries to put
 *   them on the its list; if a page belongs to the other end of the
 *   connection, it is sent back
 * - lists of pages are sent across the pipe, not individual pages, in order
 *   to minimise the number of read/write operations needed
 * - when mmap works properly, only one bytes containing the page number of
 *   the page list head is sent back and forth; the contents of that page
 *   allow to access the rest of the page list sent, and page headers on the
 *   list tell the receiving end if the page is free or has to be added to the
 *   busy list
 * - when mmap does not work, we transfer one byte to indicate the head of the
 *   page list sent, and for each page on the list of sent pages, the page
 *   header and the page payload is sent (if the page is free, we only
 *   transmit the page header, and we never transmit more payload than
 *   the page actually contains)
 * - in the child, all open BidirMMapPipes but the current one are closed. this
 *   is done for two reasons: first, to conserve file descriptors and address
 *   space. second, if more than one process is meant to use such a
 *   BidirMMapPipe, synchronisation issues arise which can lead to bugs that
 *   are hard to find and understand. it's much better to come up with a design
 *   which does not need pipes to be shared among more than two processes.
 *
 * Here is a trivial example of a parent and a child talking to each other over
 * a BidirMMapPipe:
 * @code
 * #include <string>
 * #include <iostream>
 * #include <cstdlib>
 *
 * #include "BidirMMapPipe.h"
 *
 * int simplechild(BidirMMapPipe& pipe)
 * {
 *     // child does an echo loop
 *     while (pipe.good() && !pipe.eof()) {
 *         // read a string
 *         std::string str;
 *         pipe >> str;
 *         if (!pipe) return -1;
 *         if (pipe.eof()) break;
 *         // check if parent wants us to shut down
 *         if (!str.empty()) {
 *             std::cout << "[CHILD] :  read: " << str << std::endl;
 *             str = "... early in the morning?";
 *         }
 *         pipe << str << BidirMMapPipe::flush;
 *         if (str.empty()) break;
 *         if (!pipe) return -1;
 *         std::cout << "[CHILD] : wrote: " << str << std::endl;
 *     }
 *     // send shutdown request acknowledged
 *     pipe << "" << BidirMMapPipe::flush;
 *
 *     pipe.close();
 *     return 0;
 * }
 *
 * BidirMMapPipe* spawnChild(int (*childexec)(BidirMMapPipe&))
 * {
 *     BidirMMapPipe *p = new BidirMMapPipe();
 *     if (p->isChild()) {
 *         int retVal = childexec(*p);
 *         delete p;
 *         std::exit(retVal);
 *     }
 *     return p;
 * }
 *
 * int main()
 * {
 *     std::cout << "[PARENT]: simple challenge-response test, one child:" <<
 *             std::endl;
 *     BidirMMapPipe* pipe = spawnChild(simplechild);
 *     for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
 *         std::string str("What shall we do with a drunken sailor...");
 *         *pipe << str << BidirMMapPipe::flush;
 *         if (!*pipe) return -1;
 *         std::cout << "[PARENT]: wrote: " << str << std::endl;
 *         *pipe >> str;
 *         if (!*pipe) return -1;
 *         std::cout << "[PARENT]:  read: " << str << std::endl;
 *     }
 *     // ask child to shut down
 *     pipe << "" << BidirMMapPipe::flush;
 *     // wait for it to see the shutdown request
 *     std::string s;
 *     pipe >> s;
 *     std::cout << "[PARENT]: exit status of child: " << pipe->close() <<
 *             std::endl;
 *     delete pipe;
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * When designing your own protocols to use over the pipe, there are a few
 * things to bear in mind:
 * - Do as http does: When building a request, send all the options and
 *   properties of that request with the request itself in a single go (one
 *   flush). Then, the server has everything it needs, and hopefully, it'll
 *   shut up for a while and to let the client do something useful in the
 *   meantime... The same goes when the server replies to the request: include
 *   everything there is to know about the result of the request in the reply.
 * - The expensive operation should be the request that is made, all other
 *   operations should somehow be formulated as options or properties to that
 *   request.
 * - Include a shutdown handshake in whatever protocol you send over the
 *   pipe. That way, you can shut things down in a controlled way. Otherwise,
 *   and depending on your OS's scheduling quirks, you may catch a SIGPIPE if
 *   one end closes its pipe while the other is still trying to read.

         *
         * @param pipes         set of pipes to check
         * @param timeout       timeout in milliseconds
         * @returns             positive number: number of pipes which have
         *                      status changes, 0: timeout, or no pipes with
         *                      status changed, -1 on error
         *
         * Timeout can be zero (check for specified events, and return), finite
         * (wait at most timeout milliseconds before returning), or -1
         * (infinite). The poll method returns when the timeout has elapsed,
         * or if an event occurs on one of the pipes being polled, whichever
         * happens earlier.
         *
         * Pipes is a vector of one or more PollEntries, which each list a pipe
         * and events to poll for. If events is left empty (zero), all
         * conditions are polled for, otherwise only the indicated ones. On
         * return, the revents fields contain the events that occurred for each
         * pipe; error Error, EndOfFile or Invalid events are always set,
         * regardless of wether they were in the set of requested events.
         *
         * poll may block slightly longer than specified by timeout due to OS
         * timer granularity and OS scheduling. Due to its implementation, the
         * poll call can also return early if the remote end of the page sends
         * a free page while polling (which is put on that pipe's freelist),
         * while that pipe is polled for e.g Reading. The status of the pipe is
         * indicated correctly in revents, and the caller can simply poll
         * again. (The reason this is done this way is because it helps to
         * replenish the pool of free pages and queue busy pages without
         * blocking.)
         *
