\class RooCacheManager
\ingroup Roofitcore

Template class RooCacheManager manages the storage of any type of data indexed on
the choice of normalization and optionally the set of integrated observables.
The purpose of this class is to faciliate storage of intermediate results
in operator p.d.f.s whose value and inner working are often highly dependent
on the user provided choice of normalization in getVal().

For efficiency reasons these normalization set pointer are
derefenced as little as possible. This class contains a lookup
table for RooArgSet pointer pairs -> normalization lists.  Distinct
pointer pairs that represent the same normalization/projection are
recognized and will all point to the same normalization list. Lists
for up to 'maxSize' different normalization/ projection
configurations can be cached.
