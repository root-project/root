#warning "The deprecated RooMinuit class was replaced by the more general RooMinimizer. \
Migrating to the RooMinimizer is easy because the interface is backwards compatible. \
If you still want to use the old RooMinuit, #include \"RooFitLegacy/RooMinuit\" instead."

#include "RooFitLegacy/RooMinuit.h"
