/**
 * \struct RooBatchCompute::RunContext
 *
 * This struct enables passing computation data around between elements of a computation graph.
 *
 * ### Separating data and computation graph
 * The RunContext stores read-only spans to data that has already been computed.
 * This can be data of the observables (which is constant during a fit)
 * or intermediate computation results from evaluating PDFs or formulae for every point in a dataset.
 * The latter may change as fit parameters change.
 *
 * Instead of storing information about these data *inside* nodes of the computation graph (requiring a change
 * of their state, possibly violating const-correctness), this information is stored in RunContext::spans using
 * the pointer of the element that produced those results as a key. In this way, one or multiple RunContext
 * instances can be passed around when computations are running, leaving the objects of the computation graph
 * invariant.
 *
 * ### Memory ownership model
 * The RunContext can provide memory for temporary data, that is, data that can vanish after a fit converges. Using
 * RunContext::makeBatch(), a suitable amount of memory is allocated to store computation results.
 * When intermediate data are cleared, this memory is *not freed*. In this way, temporary data can be invalidated
 * when fit parameters change, but the memory is only allocated once per fit.
 *
 * When a RunContext goes out of scope, the memory is freed. That means that in between fit cycles, a RunContext should
 * be cleared using clear(), or single results should be invalidated by removing these from RunContext::spans.
 * The RunContext object should be destroyed only *after* a fit completes.
