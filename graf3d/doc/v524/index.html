<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<ul>

<li> It is now possible to draw a histogram with the "GLBOX" in the
GL-viewer.

<li> New class <tt>TGLColor</tt> has been introduced to simplify color
management in <tt>TGLViewer</tt> and <tt>TGLRnrCtx</tt>.

<li> Add support for several color-sets (class <tt>TGLColorSet</tt> -
each defines colors for background, foreground, outline, markup and
for outlines of selected and highlighted objects.

Thios also allows for independent changing of background color and
outline mode in the GL viewer - the <tt>e</tt> key now toggles between
dark / light background.

<li> New class <tt>TGLAnnotation</tt> - it allows display of
annotation-text on top of displayed objects.

The annotation can be created from the <tt>TGLViewer</tt> editor
("Guides" tab). After that it can be dragged around the screen, edited
or closed.

<li> <tt>TGLAxisPainter</tt> - reimplemented to completely separate
label and tick-mark positioning code from the rendering itself.

<li> <tt>TGLSAViewer</tt> - when exporting an image properly take into
account image extension if it was typed by the user.

<li> <tt>TGLFont</tt> now uses the same font-naming scheme as the rest
of ROOT (had to specify font-file names before).

</ul>

<h3>Eve</h3>

<ul>

<li> <tt>TEveElement</tt> - add context-menu functions allowing the
source-object to be printed, dumped or exported to CINT.

<li> <tt>TEveTrack</tt> - added flag for locking of current
track-points - the track will not be re-extrapolated automatically
even when the extrapolation parameters are changed.

<li> <tt>TEveTrack</tt> - removed ALICE specific <tt>ImportXyzz()</tt>
functions for loading of kinematics, hits and clusters associated with
a track. These were calling macros that were not available in ROOT.

<li> Several improvements in rendering of coordinate axes
in <tt>TEveCaloLego</tt> and <tt>TEveProjectionAxes</tt>.

<li> New class <tt>TEveJetCone</tt> for display of circular and
elliptic jet-cones clipped to the calorimeter's inner surface.

<li> Add support for extraction of composite-shape tesselations. A new
class <tt>TEveGeoPolyShape</tt> has been introduced to make this
tesselation serializable. See examples
in <tt>tutorials/eve/advanced/</tt>.

<li> Generalize representation of EVE-window title-bar - it can be
modified to display user-provided icons, menus or buttons.

</ul>
