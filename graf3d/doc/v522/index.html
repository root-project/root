<h3>OpenGL</h3>

<ul>

<li> Add support for showing tooltips for objects shown in
<tt>TGLViewer</tt>. See <tt>TGLEventHandler::TriggerTooltip(const
char* text)</tt> and <tt>RemoveTooltip()</tt>. Usage example is in
class <tt>TEveViewerList</tt>.

<li> Add new overlay element <tt>TGLCameraOverlay</tt> that allows to
display: a) coordinate axes for orthographic mode; b) intersection of
center of screen with a given plane.

<li> Add suport for fading in/out of the viewer contents.

<li> Many improvements in text and axis rendering for orthographic
view markup.

<li> In <tt>TGLSceneBase</tt> add data-member <tt>Bool_t
fSelectable</tt> allowing one to preventing any of its elements to be
selected. Useful when given scene is used as background to help guid
the eye.

</ul>

<h3>Eve</h3>

<ul>

<li> Added support for internal window management. Windows can be
arranged in horizontal/vertical stacks, tabs and main windows.
The containers and individaul windows can be moved to arbitrary
window-slot.

See classes <tt>TEveWindow</tt> and <tt>TEveWindowManager</tt>.

See tutorial <tt>tutorials/eve/test_windows.C</tt>.

<li> <tt>TEveQuadSet</tt> -- Add flag 'Bool_t fAntiFlick'. If on (now the
default) it causes each quad to be also rendered as a pixel, thus
preventing it from disappearing when zoomed away.

This is needed for visualization of small quads, e.g. silicon
detectors digits.

<li> <tt>TEveCalo</tt> classes -- Add support for automatic rebinning
of 3D views (only supported for 2D views before). In 2D mode support
automatic determination of the cell color based on the most energetic
contribution from available calo slices.

Add support for enumerative registration of calorimeter towers. Before
one had to provide THStack as input. See <tt>TEveCaloDataVec</tt>
class.

<li> <tt>TEveTrackList</tt> -- Generalized API for finding of momentum
limits.

<li> <tt>TEveTrackPropagator</tt> now supports propagation of charged
particles in arbitrary / external magnetic field. Propagation can be
done with the helix-stepper or with the Runge-Kutta method.

New abstract interface to magnetic field <tt>TEveMagField</tt> to get
field vector at given position. Implement two interfaces:
<tt>TEveMagFieldConst</tt> for constant magnetic field and
<tt>TEveMagFieldDuo</tt> (two constant magnetic fields, chosen by
cylindrical radius).

See examples in <tt>tutorials/eve/track.C</tt>.

<li> <tt>TEvePointSetArray</tt> -- Added underflow and overflow bins.

<li> Many improvements in text and axis rendering for axes in
non-linear projections and for the dedicated lego view.

<li> New tutorial <tt>tutorials/eve/lineset_test.py</tt> showing how
tu run Eve from python.

</ul>
