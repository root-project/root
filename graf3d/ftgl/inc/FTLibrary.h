 * FTLibrary class is the global accessor for the Freetype library.

 * and ensures that only one FT_Library is in existence at any one time.
 * All constructors are private therefore clients cannot create or
 * instantiate this class themselves and must access it's methods via the
 * static <code>FTLibrary::Instance()</code> function.
 *
 * Just because this class returns a valid <code>FTLibrary</code> object
 * doesn't mean that the Freetype Library has been successfully initialised.
 * Clients should check for errors. You can initialse the library AND check
 * for errors using the following code...
 * <code>err = FTLibrary::Instance().Error();</code>
