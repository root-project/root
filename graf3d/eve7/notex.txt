//==============================================================================

Issues:

* Exporting top level collection(s): events, viewers, scenes

* Emitting signals

* Serialization of EveElements
  - separate internal "links" - componds, parents, projectables/eds
  - separate hierarchy ?
  - request children separately ?

* What does redraw do? We know which elements / scenes have changed.
  Has to be synchronized with expectations of the client.

* Event scene / EventManager - is it needed?

* SceneInfo

* Review ownership of shape in TEveGeoShape

* Argh, CSG/Boolean shapes were generated through GL.
  Need to re-extract Timur's stuff and hack a TPad krappe around it.
  ! Ask what is the plan for TGeo !

-----

* Inverted sign of magnetic field ... fix it.
