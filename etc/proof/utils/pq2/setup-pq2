# *BEFORE* sourcing this script it is advised to source <root_sys>/bin.thisroot.sh (or

# This adds the scripts to the execution path

# Path to the repository via server (superseeded by '-u srvurl' or --url=srvurl)
# It MUST contain the full directory spefication. To test the goodness of the path
# run gSystem->AccessPathName("<path>", kReadPermissions) in a ROOT shell: this command
# will return 0 is the path is good.

# URL of the PROOF master connected to the repository, i.e. the entry point of the
# PROOF cluster. To test the goodness of the url try to pen a PROOF session in ROOT

# NB: PROOFURL is still supported but deprecated .

# To disable the use of the cache when browsing via a remote server uncomment the following
# export DATASETCACHE="no"
# setenv DATASETCACHE "no"
# The location of the local cache is controlled by the following variable (the default is
# a path derived from $PQ2DSSRVURL (replacemente of '/' and ':' with %) under $TMPDIR

# List of operations to be done via the data server in the case both a server and a PROOF
# service are available. By the default, the browsing actions (ls, ls-files, ls-files-server,
# info-server, ana-dist) are executed via the server, the others (put, rm, verify) via
# PROOF. This allows to speed-up the operations by using caching and to reduce the load
# on the PROOF master.
# The format is "<action-tag>:" where the action tags are:
#               ls             for      ls
#               lsfiles        for      ls-files
#               filessrv       for      ls-files-server
#               infosrv        for      info-server
#               anadist        for      ana-dist
#               cache          for      cache
