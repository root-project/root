### Example of file defining groups in PROOF.
### The availability and location of this file is communicated to XProofd
### by the directive 'xpd.groupfile <group_file_path>'.
###

###
### Definition of groups.
### A user can be part of many groups; the default group is defined by the
### first occurence, so the order is important.
# group tpc ernst,pippo,mst
# group ecal abd,karl,ernst

###
### Define group properties.
### A property is defined by a name, a nominal value and an effective value
### (values must be integers); the syntax is
###     property  <group> <name> <nominal_value> [<effective_value>]
### The defaul effective value is the nominal value.
### It is up to the application to give a meaning to the values.
### Example: properties of group 'tpc'
# property tpc priority 200
# property tpc diskquota 100

### Example: properties of group 'ecal'
# property ecal priority 100
# property ecal diskquota 30

### Include a file with other directives (5.27/04 and higher only)
# include /path/sub-group.file
