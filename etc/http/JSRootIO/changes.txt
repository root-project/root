This is modified version of JSRootIO,
original version was downloaded from
https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/js

At its current state code is very differ from original
project of Bertrand, but provides very similar functionality.
Main motivation for changes - fix different errors,
make JavaScript code more flexible and be able use it in online environment.


March 2014:
1. Introduce JSROOTIO.TBuffer class, which plays similar role
   as TBuffer in native ROOT I/O. Simplifies I/O logic,
   reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.
   Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.
2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.
3. Treat special case (collection, arrays) in one place.
   This is major advantage, while any new classes can be implemented once.
4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to
   objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange
   I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.
5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.
   In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part
   and organized in similar way as online part.
6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part.
7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any
   selected data member of the class. Supported are:
   basic data types, arrays of basic data types, TString, TArray classes.
   Also any object as data member can be streamed.
8. TRootSniffer do not creates sublevels for base classes


To do:
1. Redraw of canvas do not work at all.
2. That to do with histogram infobox - it can be generated only in ROOT after Draw
3. In JSROOTIO.R__unzip buffers bigger than 16 MB (0xfffffff) are not
   treated correctly. In TKey.cxx, lines 259-275, big raw buffer cutted on blocks of 16MB.
