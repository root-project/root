This is further development of JSRootIO, original version was download from
https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/js

At its current state code is very differ from original
project of Bertrand Bellenot, but provides same functionality in default mode.
Main motivation for changes - fix different errors,
make JavaScript code more flexible and applicable for online environment.

Changes in 3.2
1. Support JSON objects embedding in html pages, produced by THttpServer
2. For small resize of canvas use autoscale functionality of SVG. Only when
   relative changes too large, redraw complete canvas again.
3. Use touch-punch.min.js to process touch events with jquery-ui


Changes in 3.1
1. Correctly show tooltips in case of overlapped objects
2. Implement JSROOT.Create() method to create supported
   in JavaScript ROOT classes like TH1 or TGraph
3. Fix problem with JSROOT.draw in HTML element with zero width (display:none)
4. Provide possibility to load user scripts with JSROOT.BuildSimpleGUI 
   and JSROOT.AssertPrerequisites, also with main index.htm
5. Support of TCutG drawing
6. Implement hierarchy display (former dtree) with jQuery
7. Fix several problems in drawing optimization
8. Implement dragging objects from hierarchy browser into existing canvas 
   to superimpose several objects 
9. Implement col2 and col3 draw options, using html5 canvas
10.Support 'p' and 'p0' draw options for TH1 class


Development of version 3.0

November 2014:
1. Better font size and position in pave stats
2. Resize/move of element only inside correspondent pad
3. Adjust of frame size when Y-axis exceed pad limits
4. Correct values in tooltip for THStack
5. Exclude drawing of markers from TGraph outside visible range
6. Drawing of canvas without TFrame object
7. Many other small bug fixes and improvements, thanks to Maximilian Dietrich

October 2014:
1. Add "shortcut icon"
2. Add demo of online THttpServer - shell script copies data from
   running httpserver.C macro on Apache webserver
3. Evaluate 'monitoring' parameter for online server like:
      http://localhost:8080/?monitoring=1000.
   Parameter defines how often displayed objects should be updated.
4. Implement 'opt' and 'opts' URL parameters for main page.
5. Show progress with scripts loading in the browser window
6. When one appends "+" to the filename, its content read completely with first I/O operation.
7. Implement JS custom streamer for TCanvas, restore aspect ratio when drawing
8. Major redesign of drawing classes. Resize and update of TCanvas are implemented.
   All major draw functions working with HTML element id as first argument.
9. Extract 3D drawings into separate JSRoot3DPainter.js script
10.Use newest three.min.js (r68) for 3D drawings, solves problem with Firefox.
11.Introduce generic list of draw functions for all supported classes.
12.Add possibility to 'expand' normal objects in the hierarchy browser.
   For instance, this gives access to single elements of canvas,
   when whole canvas cannot be drawn.
13.Correct usage of colors map, provided with TCanvas.
14.Introduce JSROOT.redraw() function which is capable to create or update object drawing.
15.In main index.htm page browser can be disabled (nobrowser parameter) and
   page can be used to display only specified items from the file
16.Add support of TPolyMarker3D in binary I/O


September 2014:
1. First try to handle resize of the browser,
   for the moment works only with collapsible layout
2. Also first try to interactively move separation line between
   browser and drawing field.
3. Small fix of minor ticks drawing on the axis
4. Introduce display class for MDI drawing. Provide two implementations -
   'collapsible' for old kind and 'tabs' for new kinds.
5. Adjust size of color palette drawing when labels would take more place as provided.
6. Add correct filling of statistic for TProfile,
   fix small problem with underflow/overflow bins.
7. Provide way to select display kind ('collapsible', 'tabs') in the simple GUI.
8. Implement 'grid' display, one could specify any number of devision like
   'grid 3x3' or 'grid 4x2'.
9. MDI display object created at the moment when first draw is performed.
10.Introduce painter class for TCanvas, support resize and update of canvas drawing
11.Resize almost works for all layouts and all objects kinds.
12.Implement JSROOT.GetUrlOption to extract options from document URL.
13.Provide example fileitem.htm how read and display item from ROOT file.
14.In default index.htm page one could specify 'file', 'layout',
   'item' and 'items' parameters like:
      http://root.cern.ch/js/3.0/index.htm?file=files/hsimple.root&layout=grid5x5&item=hpx;1
15.Support direct reading of objects from sub-sub-directories.
16.Introduce demo.htm, which demonstrates online usage of JSROOT.
17.One could use demo.htm directly with THttpServer providing address like:
     http://localhost:8080/jsrootsys/demo/demo.htm?addr=../../Files/job1.root/hpx/root.json.gz&layout=3x3
18.Also for online server process url options like 'item', 'items', 'layout'
19.Possibility to generate URL, which reproduces opened page with layout and drawn items


August 2014:
1. All communication between server and browser done with JSON format.
2. Fix small error in dtree.js - one should always set
   last sibling (_ls) property while tree can be dynamically changed.
3. In JSRootCore.js provide central function, which handles different kinds
   of XMLHttpRequest.  Use only async requests, also when getting file header.
4. Fully reorganize data management in file/tree/directory/collection hierarchical
   display. Now complete description collected in HPainter class and decoupled from
   visualization, performed with dTree.js.
5. Remove all global variables from the code.
6. Automatic scripts/style loading handled via JSROOT.loadScript() function.
   One can specify arbitrary scripts list, which asynchronously loaded by browser.
7. Method to build simple GUI changed and more simplified :). The example in index.htm.
   While loadScript and AssertPrerequisites functions moved to JSROOT, one
   can easily build many different kinds of GUIs, reusing provided JSRootCore.js functions.
8. In example.htm also use AssertPrerequisites to load necessary scripts.
   This helps to keep code up-to-date even by big changes in JavaScript code.
9. Provide monitoring of online THttpServer with similar interface as for ROOT files.
10.Fix several errors in TKey Streamer, use member names as in ROOT itself.
11.Keep the only version identifier JSROOT.version for JS code
12.One can specify in JSROOT.AssertPrerequisites functionality which is required.
   One could specify '2d', 'io' (default) or '3d'.
13.Use new AssertPrerequisites functionality to load only required functionality.
14.When displaying single element, one could specify draw options and monitor property like:
       http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=col&monitor=2000
   Such link is best possibility to integrate display into different HTML pages,
   using <iframe/> tag like:
      <iframe src="http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpx/draw.htm"
             style="width: 800px; height:600px"></iframe>
15.Remove 'JSROOTIO.' prefix from _typename. Now real class name is used.
16.Use in all scripts JSROOT as central 'namespace'
17.Introduce context menu in 3D, use it for switch between 2D/3D modes
18.Use own code to generate hierarchical structure in HTML, replace dtree.js which is
   extremely slow for complex hierarchies. Dramatically improve performance for
   structures with large (~1000) number of items.
19.Deliver to the server title of the objects, display it as hint in the browser.
20.Better handling of special characters in the hierarchies - allows to display
   symbols like ' or " in the file structure.


July 2014:
1. Migration to d3.v3.js and jQuery v2.1.1
2. Fix errors in filling of histogram statbox
3. Possibility of move and resize of statbox, title, color palete
4. Remove many (not all) global variables
5. Example with direct usage of JSRootIO graphics
6. Example of inserting ROOT graphics from THttpServer into <iframe></iframe>


May 2014:
1. This JSRootIO code together with THttpServer class included
   in ROOT repository


March 2014:
1. Introduce JSROOT.TBuffer class, which plays similar role
   as TBuffer in native ROOT I/O. Simplifies I/O logic,
   reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.
   Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.
2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.
3. Treat special cases (collection, arrays) in one place.
   This is major advantage, while any new classes need to be implemented only once.
4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to
   objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange
   I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.
5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.
   In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part
   and organized in similar way as online part.
6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part.
7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any
   selected data member of the class. Supported are:
   basic data types, arrays of basic data types, TString, TArray classes.
   Also any object as data member can be streamed.
8. TRootSniffer do not creates sublevels for base classes
