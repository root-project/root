This is further development of JSRootIO, original version was download from  
https://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/js

At its current state code is very differ from original
project of Bertrand Bellenot, but provides at most similar functionality.
Main motivation for changes - fix different errors,
make JavaScript code more flexible and applicable for online environment. 

September 2014:
1. First try to handle resize of canvas in the browser, for the 
   moment works only with collapsible layout
2. Also first try to interactively move separation line between
   browser and drawing field.
3. Small fix of minor ticks drawing on the axis
4. Introduce display class for MDI drawing. Provide two implementations - 
   'collapsible' for old kind and 'tabs' for new kinds.  
5. Adjust size of color palette drawing when labels would take more place as provided.
6. Add correct filling of statistic for TProfile, fix small problem with underflow/overflow bins.
7. Provide way to select display kind ('collapsible', 'tabs') in the simple GUI.
 

August 2014:
1. All communication between server and browser done with JSON format.
2. Fix small error in dtree.js - one should always set 
   last sibling (_ls) property while tree can be dynamically changed.  
3. In JSRootCore.js provide central function, which handles different kinds 
   of XMLHttpRequest.  Use only async requests, also when getting file header.
4. Fully reorganize data management in file/tree/directory/collection hierarchical
   display. Now complete description collected in HPainter class and decoupled from
   visualization, performed with dTree.js. 
5. Remove all global variables from the code.
6. Automatic scripts/style loading handled via JSROOT.loadScript() function.
   One can specify arbitrary scripts list, which asynchronously loaded by browser.
7. Method to build simple GUI changed and more simplified :). The example in index.htm.
   While loadScript and AssertPrerequisites functions moved to JSROOT, one
   can easily build many different kinds of GUIs, reusing provided JSRootCore.js functions.         
8. In example.htm also use AssertPrerequisites to load necessary scripts.
   This helps to keep code up-to-date even by big changes in JavaScript code.
9. Provide monitoring of online THttpServer with similar interface as for ROOT files.
10.Fix several errors in TKey Streamer, use member names as in ROOT itself.        
11.Keep the only version identifier JSROOT.version for JS code
12.One can specify in JSROOT.AssertPrerequisites functionality which is required.
   One could specify '2d', 'io' (default) or '3d'.
13.Use new AssertPrerequisites functionality to load only required functionality.
14.When displaying single element, one could specify draw options and monitor property like:
       http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=col&monitor=2000
   Such link is best possibility to integrate display into different HTML pages,
   using <iframe/> tag like:
      <iframe src="http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpx/draw.htm" 
             style="width: 800px; height:600px"></iframe>
15.Remove 'JSROOTIO.' prefix from _typename. Now real class name is used.   
16.Use in all scripts JSROOT as central 'namespace'
17.Introduce context menu in 3D, use it for switch between 2D/3D modes
18.Use own code to generate hierarchical structure in HTML, replace dtree.js which is 
   extremely slow for complex hierarchies. Dramatically improve performance for
   structures with large (~1000) number of items. 
19.Deliver to the server title of the objects, display it as hint in the browser.
20.Better handling of special characters in the hierarchies - allows to display
   symbols like ' or " in the file structure. 


July 2014:
1. Migration to d3.v3.js and jQuery v2.1.1
2. Fix errors in filling of histogram statbox
3. Possibility of move and resize of statbox, title, color palete
4. Remove many (not all) global variables
5. Example with direct usage of JSRootIO graphics
6. Example of inserting ROOT graphics from THttpServer into <iframe></iframe> 

May 2014:
1. This JSRootIO code together with THttpServer class included
   in ROOT repository 

March 2014:
1. Introduce JSROOT.TBuffer class, which plays similar role 
   as TBuffer in native ROOT I/O. Simplifies I/O logic,
   reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.
   Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.
2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.
3. Treat special cases (collection, arrays) in one place.
   This is major advantage, while any new classes need to be implemented only once.
4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to
   objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange
   I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.
5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.
   In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part
   and organized in similar way as online part.    
6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part. 
7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any 
   selected data member of the class. Supported are: 
   basic data types, arrays of basic data types, TString, TArray classes. 
   Also any object as data member can be streamed.
8. TRootSniffer do not creates sublevels for base classes
   
    
To do:
1. Redraw of canvas do not work at all.    
3. In JSROOT.R__unzip buffers bigger than 16 MB (0xfffffff) are not 
   treated correctly. In TKey.cxx, lines 259-275, big raw buffer cutted on blocks of 16MB.
