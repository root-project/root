# Concluding Remarks #

This is the end of our guided tour for beginners through ROOT. There is
still a lot coming to mind to be said, but by now you are experienced
enough to use the ROOT documentation, most importantly the **[ROOT home
page](http://root.cern.ch)** and the **[ROOT reference
guide](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/reference-guide)** with the
documentation of all ROOT classes, or the **[ROOT users
guide](http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/users-guide)**.

A very useful way for you to continue exploring ROOT is to study the
examples in the sub-directory `tutorials/` of any ROOT installation.

There are some powerful features of ROOT which were not treated in this
document, e.g. packages named RooFit and RooStats providing an advanced
framework for model building, fitting and statistical analysis. The ROOT
namespace `TMVA` offers multi-variate analysis tools including an artificial
neural network and many other advanced tools for classification
problems. The remarkable ability of ROOT to handle large data volumes
was already mentioned in this guide, implemented through the class
`TTree`. But there is still much more for you to explore!

**End of this guide ... but hopefully not of your interaction with ROOT !**
