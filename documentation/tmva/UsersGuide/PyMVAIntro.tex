\section{The PyMVA Methods}
\label{sec:pymvaClassifiers}

PyMVA is the interface for third-party MVA tools based on Python. It is created to make powerful external libraries easily accessible with a direct integration into the TMVA workflow. All PyMVA methods provide the same plug-and-play mechanisms than the TMVA methods described in section \ref{sec:tmvaClassifiers}.

Because the base method of PyMVA is inherited from the TMVA base method, all options from the Option Table \ref{opt:mva::methodbase} apply for PyMVA methods as well.
