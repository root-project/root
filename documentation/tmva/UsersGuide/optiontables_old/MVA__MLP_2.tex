                BatchSize  &  \mc{1}{c}{--}  &               -1  &  \mc{1}{l}{--}  &  Batch size: number of events/batch, only set if in Batch Mode, -1 for BatchSize=number\_of\_events \\
       ConvergenceImprove  &  \mc{1}{c}{--}  &            1e-30  &  \mc{1}{l}{--}  &  Minimum improvement which counts as improvement ($<$0 means automatic convergence check is turned off) \\
