\page MathMore MathMore library

@b MathMore provides an advanced  collection of functions and C++ classes for HEP numerical computing. This is an extension of the functionality provided by the \ref MathCore.
The current set includes classes and functions for:
<ul>
<li>\ref SpecFunc, with all the major functions (Bessel functions, Legendre polynomial, etc..)
<li>\ref StatFunc, Mathematical functions used in statistics such as  probability density functions, cumulative distributions functions and their inverse (quantiles).
<li>Numerical algorithms:
<ul>
<li>\ref Integration
<li>\ref MCIntegration
<li>\ref Deriv
<li>\ref RootFinders
<li>\ref Min1D
 <li>\ref MultiMin
</ul>
<li>\ref Interpolation
<li>\ref FuncApprox, based on Chebyshev polynomials
<li>\ref Random

</ul>
<p>
The mathematical functions are implemented as a set of free functions in the namespace \em ROOT::Math. The naming used for the special functions is the same proposed for the C++ standard (see C++ standard extension <A HREF="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2004/n1687.pdf"> proposal document</A>).

The MathMore library is implemented wrapping in C++ the GNU Scientific Library (<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl">GSL</A>).
<br>
To build MathMore you need to have first GSL installed somewhere in your system.  A version of GSL larger or equal 1.8 is required.
A tar file of GSL can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/#downloading">GSL Web site</A>, or (for version 1.8) from
<A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/gsl-1.8.tar.gz">here</A>. Windows binaries, compiled using Visual Studio 7.1 can be downloaded from  <A HREF="http://seal.web.cern.ch/seal/MathLibs/GSL-1.8.zip">this location</A>.
<p>
MathMore (and its %ROOT CINT dictionary)  can be built within %ROOT whenever a GSL library is found in the system. Optionally the GSL library and header file location can be specified in the %ROOT configure script with <em>configure --with-gsl-incdir=... --with-gsl-libdir=...</em>
<p>
MathMore can be built also a stand-alone library (without requiring %ROOT) downloding the tar file from the Web. Note that in this case the library will <strong>NOT</strong> contain the dictionary information and therefore cannot be used interactivly.
<br>
The current standalone version of MathMore can be downloaded <A HREF="../MathMore.tar.gz">here</A>.
<br>
To build the library run first the script <em>configure --with-gsl="gsl_dir_location"</em> and then <em>make</em>. Do <em>configure --help</em> to see options available in configuring, like defining the installation directory. Run also <em>make install</em> to install the library and include files and <em>make check</em> to build the tests.
