<h4>MathCore</h4>
 Various fixes have been applied. mainly  in the fitting classes, in detail:
<ul>
  <li>Fix issue <a href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?46006">#46006</a> for normalization of error resulting from fitting a TGraph</li>
  <li>Fix a problem in Chi2 calculation in case of overflow</li>
  <li>Fix issue <href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?46601">#46601</a> for avoiding crashes when a linear fit fails.</li>
   <li>Fix in the FitData classes the bug <href="http://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?45909">#45909</a> occurring when setting a function range outside histogram range</li>
   <li>Fix default integration method to be Gauss algorithm of MathCore instead of the GSL method, when libMathmore is not built or when the plug-in manager fails to load it.
   <li>Add a protection against negative log when fitting using the Poisson log likelihood function
   <li>Improve calculation of derivative in x for fitted function. This fixes some problem observed when fitting using the error on the coordinates.  
  </ul>

 <h4>MathMore</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li>Fix 2 bugs in the quartic equation solver (see issue <a href="https://savannah.cern.ch/bugs/?49031">#49031</a>).
    <ul><li>
    A protection has been added against numerical errors which could cause NaN due to wrong inputs to an <tt>acos</tt> function.
      <li>
   A wrong statement (coming from the original CERNLIB code but not applicable in this case)  has been removed.
      </ul>
    </li>
 </ul>

  <h4>SMatrix</h4>
  <ul> 
    <li>Remove an unneeded check on the element value in the factorization routines used for inverting the matrices (both for the LU and for the  Bunch-Kaufmann factorization). The check was preventing to inverting matrices when some of the matrix elements (like the diagonal) were smaller than an epsilon value set to ~ 10-15. This is not needed since it is enough to check that the values are not zero (i.e. when the matrix is singular). This bug was causing several failures in the CMS code when inverting matrices.  
    </li>
 </ul>

<h4>Minuit2</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Apply some fixes in MnHesse and MnPosDef classes to check correctly variables to not be zero.
    (use same checks as in F77Minuit)
    </li>
    <li>Fix a bug introduced in DavidonErrorCalculator when checking for delgam. Negative values are allowed. This fixes a test problem given privately by A. Suter.
    </li>
    <li>Uses also a tighter condition on edm when exiting the iterations (factor of 5 smaller). This is more consistent with conditions used by F77Minuit.
    </li>
    <li>Fix a bug in MnCross in the standalone version of Minuit (when WARNINGMSG was not defined).
    </li>
    <li>Fix a bug in the sign of the derivative for sine transformation which are used with double bound parameters. The bug could affect the minimization of function with user provided gradient and bound parameters and bound parameters. It could also affected Fumili2. Furthermore, a wrong sign for the correlation matrix could also have been obtained in some cases with bound parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
    Fix a problem in building the parallel version of Minuit2. The parallel version is built if the environment variables USE_PARALLEL_MINUIT2 and USE_OPENMP are set before compiling Minuit2 on a compiler which supports openMP (for example gcc version >= 4.2) 
    </li>
</ul>



<h4>TRolke</h4>
New version of TRolke from J. Lundberg.
<ul>
  <li>
The interface of the class has been changed. The old user interface was very hard to use, and the documentation in the source was also not on par with the correct usage. The old interface was a single get-function with 12 arguments, and the user was supposed to figure out which ~ 5 arguments were relevant for a specific model (1 out of 7 models).
  <br>
The new user interface is is easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly (TM). It's a single set-method for each method:
<pre>
SetPoissonBkgBinomialEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Int_t z,Double_t tau,Int_t m);
SetPoissonBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Double_t em, Double_t tau,Double_t sde);
SetGaussianBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Double_t bm,Double_t em, Double_t sde,Double_t sdb);
SetPoissondBkgknownEff(Int_t x,Int_t y,Double_t tau,Double_t e);
SetGaussianBkgknownEff(Int_t x,Double_t bm,Double_t sdb,Double_t e);
SetKnownBkgBinomialEff(Int_t x, Int_t z,Int_t m,Double_t b);
SetknownBkgGaussianEff(Int_t x,Double_t em,Double_t sde,Double_t b);
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>New methods for getting sensitivity (average limits) and related quantities and for critical number related to rejection of the null-hypothesis (no signal).
 <li>Some small Bug fixes. Some variables were used uninitialized. (Eg, input arguments which were not supposed to be used were used anyway.)

  </ul>
