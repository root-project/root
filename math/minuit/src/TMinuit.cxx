   The Minuit Minimization package.
   Direct C++ implementation of the Minuit minimization package.
   This package was originally written in Fortran by Fred James
   and part of PACKLIB (patch D506)
   It has been converted to a C++ class, TMinuit, by R.Brun.
*/

/** \class TMinuit

Implementation in C++ of the Minuit package written by Fred James.
This is a straightforward conversion of the original Fortran version.

The main changes are:

   - The variables in the various Minuit labelled common blocks
     have been changed to the TMinuit class data members.

   - The internal arrays with a maximum dimension depending on the
     maximum number of parameters are now data members arrays with
     a dynamic dimension such that one can fit very large problems
     by simply initialising the TMinuit constructor with the maximum
     number of parameters.

   - The include file Minuit.h has been commented as much as possible
     using existing comments in the code or the printed documentation

   - The original Minuit subroutines are now member functions.

   - Constructors and destructor have been added.

   - Instead of passing the FCN  function in the argument
     list, the addresses of this function is stored as pointer
     in the data members of the class. This is by far more elegant
     and flexible in an interactive environment.
     The member function SetFCN can be used to define this pointer.

   - The ROOT static function Printf is provided to replace all
     format statements and to print on currently defined output file.
   - The functions SetObjectFit(TObject * obj)/GetObjectFit() can be
     used inside the FCN function to set/get a referenced object
     instead of using global variables.


## Basic concepts of MINUIT

The [MINUIT](https://root.cern.ch/sites/d35c7d8c.web.cern.ch/files/minuit.pdf)
package acts on a multiparameter Fortran function to which one
must give the generic name <TT>FCN</TT>. In the ROOT implementation,
the function <TT>FCN</TT> is defined via the MINUIT SetFCN member function
when an Histogram.Fit command is invoked.
The value of <TT>FCN</TT> will in general depend on one
or more variable parameters.

To take a simple example, in case of ROOT histograms (classes TH1C,TH1S,TH1F,TH1D)
the Fit function defines the Minuit fitting function as being H1FitChisquare
or H1FitLikelihood depending on the options selected.
H1FitChisquare
calculates the chisquare between the user fitting function (gaussian, polynomial,
user defined,etc) and the data for given values of the parameters.
It is the task of MINUIT to find those values of the parameters
which give the lowest value of chisquare.

### Basic concepts - The transformation for parameters with limits.

For variable parameters with limits, MINUIT uses the following
transformation:

\f[
P_{\mathrm{int}} = \arcsin
        \left( 2\: \frac{P_{\mathrm{ext}}-a}{b-a} - 1 \right)
P_{\mathrm{ext}} = a + \frac{b - a}{2} \left( \sin P_{\mathrm{int}} + 1 \right)
\f]

so that the internal value \f$P_{\mathrm{int}}\f$ can take on any value, while
the external value \f$P_{\mathrm{ext}}\f$ can take on values only between the lower
limit \f$a\f$ and the upper limit \f$b\f$.
Since the transformation is necessarily non-linear, it would transform a
nice linear problem into a nasty non-linear one, which is the reason why
limits should be avoided if not necessary.
In addition, the transformation
does require some computer time, so it slows down the computation a little
bit, and more importantly, it introduces additional numerical inaccuracy into
the problem in addition to what is introduced in the numerical calculation
of the FCN value.
The effects of non-linearity and numerical roundoff both
become more important as the external value gets closer to one of the limits
(expressed as the distance to nearest limit divided by distance between limits).
The user must therefore be aware of the fact that, for example,
if he puts limits of \f$(0,10^{10})\f$ on a parameter, then the values \f$0.0\f$
and \f$1.0\f$ will be indistinguishable to the accuracy of most machines.

The transformation also affects the parameter error matrix, of course,
so Minuit does a transformation of the error matrix (and the
``parabolic'' parameter errors) when there are parameter limits.
Users should however realize that the transformation is only a linear
approximation, and that it cannot give a meaningful result if one or more
parameters is very close to a limit, where
\f$\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}} / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}} \approx 0\f$.
Therefore, it is recommended that:

  1. Limits on variable parameters should be used only when needed in order
to prevent the parameter from taking on unphysical values.

  2. When a satisfactory minimum has been found using limits, the limits
should then be removed if possible, in order to perform or re-perform the
error analysis without limits.


### How to get the right answer from MINUIT.

MINUIT offers the user a choice of several minimization algorithms. The
MIGRAD algorithm is in general the best minimizer for
nearly all functions. It is a variable-metric method with inexact line
search, a stable metric updating scheme, and checks for
positive-definiteness. Its main weakness is that it depends heavily on
knowledge of the first derivatives, and fails miserably if they are very
inaccurate.

If parameter limits are needed, in spite of the side effects, then the
user should be aware of the following techniques to alleviate problems
caused by limits:

#### Getting the right minimum with limits.

If MIGRAD converges normally to a point where no parameter is near one of
its limits, then the existence of limits has probably not prevented MINUIT
from finding the right minimum. On the other hand, if one or more
parameters is near its limit at the minimum, this may be because the true
minimum is indeed at a limit, or it may be because the minimizer has
become ``blocked'' at a limit. This may normally happen only if the
parameter is so close to a limit (internal value at an odd multiple of
\f$\pm \frac{\pi}{2}\f$
that MINUIT prints a warning to this effect when it prints
the parameter values.

The minimizer can become blocked at a limit, because at a limit
the derivative seen by the minimizer
\f$\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{int}}\f$
is zero no matter what the real derivative
\f$\partial F / \partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}\f$ is.

\f[
\frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}}                =
\frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}
\frac{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}{\partial P_{\mathrm{int}}} =
\frac{\partial F}{\partial P_{\mathrm{ext}}}                = 0
\f]

#### Getting the right parameter errors with limits.

In the best case, where the minimum is far from any limits, MINUIT will
correctly transform the error matrix, and the parameter errors it reports
should be accurate and very close to those you would have got without
limits. In other cases (which should be more common, since otherwise you
wouldn't need limits), the very meaning of parameter errors becomes
problematic. Mathematically, since the limit is an absolute constraint on
the parameter, a parameter at its limit has no error, at least in one
direction. The error matrix, which can assign only symmetric errors, then
becomes essentially meaningless.

### Interpretation of Parameter Errors:

There are two kinds of problems that can arise: the reliability of
MINUIT's error estimates, and their statistical interpretation, assuming
they are accurate.

### Statistical interpretation:

For discussion of basic concepts, such as the meaning of the elements of
the error matrix, or setting of exact confidence levels see:

  1. F.James.
     Determining the statistical Significance of experimental Results.
     Technical Report DD/81/02 and CERN Report 81-03, CERN, 1981.

  2. W.T.Eadie, D.Drijard, F.James, M.Roos, and B.Sadoulet.
     Statistical Methods in Experimental Physics.
     North-Holland, 1971.

### Reliability of MINUIT error estimates.

MINUIT always carries around its own current estimates of the parameter
errors, which it will print out on request, no matter how accurate they
are at any given point in the execution. For example, at initialization,
these estimates are just the starting step sizes as specified by the user.
After a HESSE step, the errors are usually quite accurate,
unless there has been a problem. MINUIT, when it prints out error values,
also gives some indication of how reliable it thinks they are. For
example, those marked <TT>CURRENT GUESS ERROR</TT> are only working values
not to be believed, and <TT>APPROXIMATE ERROR</TT> means that they have
been calculated but there is reason to believe that they may not be
accurate.

If no mitigating adjective is given, then at least MINUIT believes the
errors are accurate, although there is always a small chance that MINUIT
has been fooled. Some visible signs that MINUIT may have been fooled are:


  1. Warning messages produced during the minimization or error analysis.

  2. Failure to find new minimum.

  3. Value of <TT>EDM</TT> too big (estimated Distance to Minimum).

  4. Correlation coefficients exactly equal to zero, unless some parameters
     are known to be uncorrelated with the others.

  5. Correlation coefficients very close to one (greater than 0.99). This
     indicates both an exceptionally difficult problem, and one which has been
     badly parameterised so that individual errors are not very meaningful
     because they are so highly correlated.

  6. Parameter at limit. This condition, signalled by a MINUIT warning
     message, may make both the function minimum and parameter errors
     unreliable. See the discussion above ``Getting the right parameter errors
     with limits''.


The best way to be absolutely sure of the errors, is to use
``independent'' calculations and compare them, or compare the calculated
errors with a picture of the function. Theoretically, the covariance
matrix for a ``physical'' function must be positive-definite at the
minimum, although it may not be so for all points far away from the
minimum, even for a well-determined physical problem. Therefore, if MIGRAD
reports that it has found a non-positive-definite covariance matrix, this
may be a sign of one or more of the following:

##### A non-physical region:

On its way to the minimum, MIGRAD may have traversed a region which has
unphysical behaviour, which is of course not a serious problem as long as
it recovers and leaves such a region.

##### An underdetermined problem:

If the matrix is not positive-definite even at the minimum, this may mean
that the solution is not well-defined, for example that there are more
unknowns than there are data points, or that the parameterisation of the
fit contains a linear dependence. If this is the case, then MINUIT (or any
other program) cannot solve your problem uniquely, and the error matrix
will necessarily be largely meaningless, so the user must remove the
under-determinedness by reformulating the parameterisation. MINUIT cannot
do this itself.

##### Numerical inaccuracies:

It is possible that the apparent lack of positive-definiteness is in fact
only due to excessive roundoff errors in numerical calculations in the
user function or not enough precision. This is unlikely in general, but
becomes more likely if the number of free parameters is very large, or if

the parameters are badly scaled (not all of the same order of magnitude),
and correlations are also large. In any case, whether the
non-positive-definiteness is real or only numerical is largely irrelevant,
since in both cases the error matrix will be unreliable and the minimum
suspicious.

##### An ill-posed problem:

For questions of parameter dependence, see the discussion above on
positive-definiteness.

Possible other mathematical problems are the following:

##### Excessive numerical roundoff:

Be especially careful of exponential and factorial functions which get big
very quickly and lose accuracy.

##### Starting too far from the solution:

The function may have unphysical local minima, especially at infinity in
some variables.

##### Minuit parameter errors in the presence of limits
This concerns the way Minuit reports the symmetric (or parabolic)  errors
on parameters.  It does not apply to the errors reported from Minos, which
are in general asymmetric.

The symmetric errors reported by Minuit are always calculated from
the covariance matrix, assuming that this matrix has been calculated,
usually as the result of a Migrad minimization or a direct
calculation by Hesse which inverts the second derivative matrix.

When there are no limits on the parameter in question, the error reported
by Minuit should therefore be exactly equal to the square root of the
corresponding diagonal element of the error matrix reported by Minuit.

However, when there are limits on the parameter, there is a transformation
between the internal parameter values seen by Minuit (which are unbounded)
and the external parameter values seen by the user in FCN (which remain
inside the desired limits).  Therefore the internal error matrix kept by
Minuit must be transformed to an external error matrix for the user.
This is done by multiplying the (I,J)th element by DEXDIN(I)*DEXDIN(J),
where DEXDIN is the derivative of the external value with respect to the
internal value at the minimum.  This is a linearisation of the
transformation, and is the only way to produce an error matrix in external
coordinates meaningful to the user.  But when reporting the individual
parabolic errors for limited parameters, Minuit can do a little better, so
it does.  In this case, Minuit actually transforms the ends of the
internal "error bar" to external coordinates and reports the length of
this transformed interval.  Strictly speaking, it is now asymmetric, but
since the origin of the asymmetry is only an artificial transformation it
does not make much sense, so the transformed errors are symmetrized.

The result of all the above is that for parameters with limits, the error
reported by Minuit is not exactly equal to the square root of the diagonal
element of the error matrix.  The difference is a measure of how much the
limits deform the problem.  If possible, it is suggested not to use limits
on parameters, and the problem goes away.  If for some reason limits are
necessary, and you are sensitive to the difference between the two ways of
calculating the errors, it is suggested to use Minos errors which take
into account the non-linearities much more precisely.
