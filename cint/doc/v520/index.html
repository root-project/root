<h3>CINT</h3>
<ul><li><em>Core.</em>
Several small fixes, e.g. for the loading of CINT vs. Cintex base dictionaries, and auto-loading of templated classes, CINT's representation of size_t, char* vs. const char* in CINT's C API.
A change in CINT does not trigger a rebuild all of ROOT's dictionaries anymore; they now depend on cintdictversion.h.
</li>


<li><em>Reflex.</em>Several fundamental enhancements are available for Reflex. This is a precursor to the API changes already announced for the near future.
<ul><li>Allow selection.xml to select or exclude functions and exclude methods based on their prototype using the attributes <tt>proto</tt> and <tt>proto_pattern</tt>. Example: &lt;function proto_pattern="(float*"&gt; will select all functions taking a float as first argument.</li>
<lt>Reflex types are now residing in the namespace <tt>Reflex</tt>; a <tt>using namespace ROOT::Reflex;</tt> has been added to the namespace Reflex to make the transition more transparent.</li>
<li>The class <tt>Reflex::Reflex</tt> has been renamed to <tt>Reflex::Instance</tt>. Its member <tt>Shutdown()</tt> is now protected; simply remove all calls: they are not needed anymore.</li>
<li>Several functions now take modifier masks for certain operations, e.g. <tt>Type::IsEquivalentTo()</tt></li>
<li>fix determination of FinalType()</li></ul>
</li>


<li><em>Cintex.</em> <ul>
<li>Classes declared to CINT via Cintex now have an artificial source file set; fixes problem with CINT expecting a valid source file and Cintex not providing any.</li>
<li>Fix auto-loading of Cintex itself.</li>
<li>Increase the size of a local table, fixing a problem with long type names.</li></ul>
</li>

</ul>
