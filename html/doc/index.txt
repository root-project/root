DUMMY - a howto, for now.

The content of a file called index.html or index.txt will be put
into the module index page (e.g. into GUI/index.html).
All other files will be linked.

.txt files will be run through THtml::Convert, html files will be kept.
Only files ending on .txt or .html will be considered as module documentation.
