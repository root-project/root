The purpose of this machinery is to search Python and set both the ROOT and PyROOT related
Python variables.

Variables set when Interpreter is found:
  - PYTHON_EXECUTABLE
  - PYTHON_VERSION_STRING
  - PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR
  - PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR

Variables set when Development is found:
  - PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS
  - PYTHON_LIBRARIES
  - PYTHON_LINK_OPTIONS: necessary on MacOS to link to the XCode Python

^^^^^^^^

Explanation of the machinery:

The first distinction is based on the CMake version used to build. If it is >= 3.14, than PyROOT can be built
for multiple Python versions. In case CMake >= 3.14, then we check if PYTHON_EXECUTABLE was specified by the user;
if so, PyROOT is built with only that version.

If PYTHON_EXECUTABLE is specified:
    - we check which version it is (from here call X) and call the relative
    find_package(PythonX COMPONENTS Interpreter Development Numpy)
    - if Interpreter is found, we set the ROOT related Python variables
    - if Development is found, we set the PyROOT variables (+ Numpy ones)

If PYTHON_EXECUTABLE is NOT specified:
    - we look for Python3, since we want the highest version to be the preferred one
    - if Python3 Interpreter is found, we set the ROOT related Python variables
    - if Python3 Development is found, we set the PyROOT_Main variables (+ Numpy ones)
