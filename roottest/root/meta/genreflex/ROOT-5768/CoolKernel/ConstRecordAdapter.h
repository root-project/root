   *
   *  Read-only wrapper of a constant coral::AttributeList reference,
   *  implementing the cool::IRecord interface. The adapter can only be
   *  used as long as the AttributeList is alive. The adapter creates
   *  its own RecordSpecification from one specified at construction time.
   *
   *  All non-const methods throw: this is effectively a read-only class.
   *
   *  The StorageType constraints on the data values of all fields
   *  are enforced in all copy constructors and assignment operators.
