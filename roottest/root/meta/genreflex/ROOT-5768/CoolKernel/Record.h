  /** @class Record Record.h
   *
   *  Implementation of cool::IRecord interface based on the
   *  coral::AttributeList class. A Record owns its own data
   *  (stored internally as an AttributeList) and specification.
   *
   *  The StorageType constraints on the data values of all fields
   *  are enforced in all copy constructors and assignment operators.
   *  Their validation when changing these data values is delegated
   *  to the concrete implementation of IField::setValue.
