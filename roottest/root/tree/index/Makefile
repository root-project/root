# Search for Rules.mk in roottest/scripts
# Algorithm:  Find the current working directory and remove everything after
#  '*roottest/'.  Append the path for Rules.mk from within roottest, which 
#  should be 'scripts/Rules.mk'.  The roottest path is saved in the
#  ROOTTEST_HOME variable for use by the SUBDIRECTORIES variable and is 
#  exported to eliminate the overhead of findding the path again during 
#  recursive calls of gmake.
# Since all makefiles should be under roottest or one of its
#  subdirectories and all recursions of gmake are called by 
#    'cd [DIR]; gmake ...'
#  this algorithm should not fail in finding /roottest/ in the
#  current working directory.  
# Issues:  This algorithm will fail if a makefile is called from outside the 
#  roottest folder, as in executing 'gmake -f ~/roottest/Makefile' from 
#  the home directory.
