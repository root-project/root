# Test files created with ROOT 6-32-19

After running

    ctest -R roottest-root-io-newstl

several root files are created in roottest/root/io/newstl directory

With every new ROOT version one can commit such files into repository
and add corresponding reading entry into cmake files.

One should add files only from previous ROOT versions - otherwise
log reference files will differ
