<h3>Histogram package</h3>

<h4>THistPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li><tt>TPad::SetTheta()</tt> and <tt>TPad::SetPhi()</tt> did not cause the
canvas redrawing.</li>
<li> Protection added in case two histograms were plotted in the same pad
using the option BOX (the 2nd one with option SAME).
The clipping was not correct when an interactive zoom was performed.
</li>
<li> The 2D functions, for instance a fit function, associated to a 2D
histogram were always drawn as scatter plots. This was very confusing.
Now they are drawn as a surface if the histogram plotting option is a
lego or a surface or as a contour plot for any other plotting options.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TH2Poly</h4>
<ul>
<li> <tt>Add(const TH1 *h1, Double_t c1)</tt> has been implemented.</li>
<li> <tt>Reset()</tt> has been implemented.</li>
<li> The destructor has been completed.</li>
</ul>

<h4>THStack</h4>
<ul>
<li> When the 1D histograms in a stack are painted with patterns or hatches
  the histograms are first painted with the TFrame background color to avoid
  the hatches overlaps. In case the TFrame background color was 0 this did not
  work because in that case the histogram is painted hollow. Instead of 0 we
  now use 10 (also white).
</ul>

<h4>TGraph</h4>
<ul>
<li> The default browsing option for graphs is now <tt>"alp"</tt>.<li>
<li> Like <tt>SetPoint</tt> the method <tt>Apply</tt> modifies the graph
     content. So, a logic similar to the one implemented in <tt>SetPoint</tt>
     is now done, ie:
     <ol>
     <li> if fHistogram exists it is reset.</li>
     <li> if gPad exist a gPad->Modified() is issued.</li>
     <ol>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraphErrors</h4>
<ul>
<li>The following macro generated wrong C++ code.
<pre>
{
   TGraphErrors *ge = new TGraphErrors(2);
   ge->SetName("aaa");    // <<< without this it works
   ge->SetPoint(1, 1, 1); ge->SetPoint(2, 2, 1);
   ge->Draw("ap*");
   gPad->Update();
   ge->SavePrimitive(cout);
}
</pre>
</li>
<li> The option "0" for graphs with error bars is no implemented:
  <p> "By default, when a data point is outside the visible range 
   along the Y axis the error bars are not drawn. Combined with 
   other options, this option forces error bars' drawing for the 
   data points outside the visible range along the Y axis."</p>
  <p>A similar option already existed for histograms.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<tt>TSVDUnfold</tt>
<ul>
<li>Rescaling using full covariance matrix rather than neglecting 
correlations.</li>
<li>Computed covariance matrix via <tt>GetXtau()</tt> and inverse via
<tt>GetXinv()</tt>.</li>
</ul>
