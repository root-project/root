<h4>TGraphDelaunay</h4>
<ul>
<li> New version of the method <tt>TGraphDelaunay::Enclose()</tt>. This method
     decides if a point is inside a triangle or not. The way it was implemented
     produced infinite numbers and generated wrong peaks. It was visible on some
     machines only (for instance MacOsX). Now this method uses
     <tt>TMath::IsInside()</tt>. It is much safer, it runs faster, and the
     code is simpler. The problem could be seen with a simple macro like the
     following one:
     <pre>
     {
        TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1", "c1",0,0,600,600);
        c1->SetTheta(90.);
        c1->SetPhi(0.0001);
        gStyle->SetPalette(1);
        TGraph2D *graph2d = new TGraph2D();
        graph2d->SetPoint(0, 110, 110, 0.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(1, -80,  50, 1.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(2, -70,  40, 2.0);
        graph2d->SetPoint(3,-110, -50, 3.0);
        graph2d->SetNpx(9);
        graph2d->SetNpy(9);
        graph2d->Draw("surf1");
        graph2d->SetLineWidth(2);
        graph2d->Draw(" triw p0 same");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> The X and Y vectors are normalized in order to compute the triangles.
     The scale factor used was the same for the X and Y axis.
     This generated problems (very long triangles instead of the obvious ones)
     in some cases when the X and Y axis had very different ranges. Having two
     scale factors, one for the X axis and one for the Y axis, cures the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraph2D</h4>
<ul>
<li> In case all the points are in the same Z-plane Z0 (zmin = zmax), the graph
     minimum is set to Z0-0.01*Z0 and the maximum to Z0+0.01*Z0. This
     allow to make <tt>TGraph2D</tt> like:
     <pre>
     {
        double *x = new double[2];
        double *y = new double[2];
        double *z = new double[2];
        x[0] = 6215.;
        x[1] = 5542.;
        y[0] = 3853.;
        y[1] = 5270.;
        z[0] = 2723.;
        z[1] = 2723.;
        TGraph2D * g = new TGraph2D(2, x, y, z);
        g->Draw("LINE");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraph2DPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li> When a <tt>TGraph2D</tt> was painted with the option <tt>TRI1</tt> the
     color distribution in case of log scale along the Z axis was wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h4>THistPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li> After executing the following macro, zooming the X axis interactively
     generated the error message:
     <br/>
     <tt>Error in &lt;TGraphPainter::PaintGraphHist&gt;: X must have N+1 values with option N </tt>
     <pre>
     {
        int n = 70;
        TH1F h("h","test",n,0.,30.);
        TRandom3 rndm_engine;
        for (int i=0; i&lt;10000; ++i) h->Fill(rndm_engine->Gaus(15.,4.));
        TF1 f("f","gaus");
        h->Fit("f");
        gPad->SetLogx();
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> The following macro didn't draw any box. Because of a precision
     problem the filled bin was not drawn.
     <pre>
     {
        double yarr[] = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 };
        double xarr[] = { 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 };
        TH2D *h = new TH2D("h","h",3,xarr,3,yarr);
        h->Fill(0.011,2.5);
        h->Draw("box");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> The following macro displayed the histogram out of the frame
     (option "bar"):
     <pre>
     {
        gStyle->SetHistMinimumZero();
        TH1F* h = new TH1F("h","h", 44, -0.5, 43.5);
        h->SetBarWidth(0.7);
        h->SetBarOffset(0.2);
        h->SetFillColor(kGreen);
        for (int i=0;i&lt;44; i++ ) h->Fill(i, -i-60);
        h->DrawCopy("bar1");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> The setting <tt>gStyle->SetHistMinimumZero()</tt> now works for horizontal
     plots produced with the option <tt>HBAR</tt>.
     <center><img src="hbarmin0.gif" alt="HBAR option"/></center>
</li>
<li> In the case of profile histograms it is possible to print the number
     of entries instead of the bin content. It is enough to combine the
     option "E" (for entries) with the option "TEXT".
     <pre>
     {
        TCanvas *c02 = new TCanvas("c02","c02",700,400);
        c02->Divide(2,1);
        TProfile *profile = new TProfile("profile","profile",10,0,10);
        profile->SetMarkerSize(2.2);
        profile->Fill(0.5,1);
        profile->Fill(1.5,2);
        profile->Fill(2.5,3);
        profile->Fill(3.5,4);
        profile->Fill(4.5,5);
        profile->Fill(5.5,5);
        profile->Fill(6.5,4);
        profile->Fill(7.5,3);
        profile->Fill(8.5,2);
        profile->Fill(9.5,1);
        c02->cd(1); profile->Draw("HIST TEXT0");
        c02->cd(2); profile->Draw("HIST TEXT0E");
     }
     </pre>
     <center><img src="textoption.gif" alt="TEXT option"/></center>
</li>
<li> The following lines generated an empty stats box:
     <pre>
     gStyle->SetStatFont(43);
     gStyle->SetStatFontSize(12);
     TH2D *h2 = new TH2D("h2","h2",10,0,1,10,0,1);
     h2->Draw();
     </pre>
</li>
<li> PaintAxis does not redraw the axis labels and the axis title in case
     of axis redrawing. Only the tick marks are redrawn. Redrawing the
     labels and title made them appear a bit thicker.
</li>
<li> Fix a precision issue in PaintInit. The problem showed up with
     the following lines:
     <pre>
     TF1 *f = new TF1("f","exp(-x)*exp(x-2.)",0.,2.0);
     f->Draw();
     </pre>
</li>
<li> For 2D histograms plotted with option <tt>TEXT</tt>, it is possible to
     plot empty cells by calling <tt>gStyle->SetHistMinimumZero()</tt>.
</li>
<li> An empty frame is drawn when an empty 1D histogram is painted with log
     scale along the Y axis and when a 2D histogram is painted with log scale
     along the Z axis.
</li>
<li> Log axis for TH3 histograms did not work.
</li>
<li> With option COL and SCAT, TH2 was drawn empty when all bins have the same content.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraphPainter</h4>
<ul>
<li> When painted with option "2" (errors represented with boxes) the graph
     with error bars were not clipped if the boxes were outside the frame
     limits. This problem was visible with TGraphErrors, TGraphAsymmErrors and
     TGraphBentErrors. The following macro showed the problem:
     <pre>
     {
        TCanvas *c1 = new TCanvas("c1","c1",200,10,700,500);

        const Int_t n    = 10;
        Double_t x[n]    = {-0.22, 0.05, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.61,0.7,0.85,0.89,0.95};
        Double_t y[n]    = {1,2.9,5.6,7.4,9,9.6,8.7,6.3,4.5,1};
        Double_t ex[n]   = {.05,.1,.07,.07,10.04,.05,.06,.07,.08,.05};
        Double_t ey[n]   = {3.8,.7,.6,.5,.4,.4,.5,.6,.7,.8};
        Double_t exd[n] = {.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0};
        Double_t eyd[n] = {.0,.0,.05,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0,.0};

        TGraphErrors *gr1 = new TGraphErrors(n,x,y,ex,ey);
        gr1->SetFillStyle(3004);

        TGraphAsymmErrors *gr2 = new TGraphAsymmErrors(n, x, y, ex, ex, ey, ey);
        gr2->SetFillStyle(3005);

        TGraphBentErrors *gr3 = new TGraphBentErrors(n,x,y,ex,ex,ey,ey,exd,exd,eyd,eyd);
        gr3->SetFillStyle(3006);

        c1->DrawFrame(-1,0,1,10);

        gr1->Draw("2");
        gr2->Draw("2");
        gr3->Draw("2");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> In PaintGraphBentErrors the fill style was not set for the boxes.</li>
<li> The following macro displayed the histogram out of the frame
     (option "b"):
     <pre>
     {
        gStyle->SetHistMinimumZero();
        TH1F* h = new TH1F("h","h", 44, -0.5, 43.5);
        h->SetBarWidth(0.7);
        h->SetBarOffset(0.2);
        h->SetFillColor(kGreen);
        for (int i=0;i&lt;44; i++ ) h->Fill(i, -i-60);
        h->DrawCopy("b");
     }
     </pre>
</li>
<li> It was not possible to interactively move a graph with many points
     close to each other. It was only possible to move the points one by one.</li>
<li> PaintGrapHist: improvements with the option "][".</li>
<li> The new markers (style 32 to 34) were not taken into account in the
     error bars drawing. Ie: the error bars were crossing the down triangle
     (style 32)</li>
</ul>

<h4>TGraph</h4>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug in <tt>TGraph::Eval</tt> when evaluating at the graph point
    values. </li>
<li> With the following macro the axis title was not displayed:
    <pre>
    {
       TGraph *graph = new TGraph ();
       graph->SetPoint(0, 0.00100, 30.00);
       graph->SetPoint(1, 0.00150, 20.00);
       graph->SetPoint(2, 0.01150, 30.00);
       graph->Draw("AL*");
       graph->GetXaxis()->SetTitle("foo") ;
       gPad->SetLogx(1) ;
    }
    </pre>
</li>
<li>New method <tt>IsInside(x,y)</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TMultiGraph</h4>
<ul>
<li>New method <tt>IsInside(x,y)</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>THStack</h4>
<ul>
<li>The color index used to erase the background while drawing a stack of 1D
    histogram was wrong.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TF1</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Bug fixed in TF1 zooming on Y axis. To reproduce it do:
     <pre>
     root [0] TF1 f1( "f1", "-x", 1,3)
     root [1] f1.Draw()
     </pre>
     now selecting some range on the y-axis with the mouse
     jumped to the range (0, 1) instead of chosen range.
  </li>
  <li> Add in <tt>TF1::GetX</tt> and <tt>TF1::GetMaximum, TF1::GetMinimum</tt> and
  <tt>TF1::GetMaximumX, TF1::GetMinimumX</tt> the tolerance and max number
  of iterations as extra parameters with default values of
  tolerance=10E-10 and max iterations=100
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>TH1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a faster version of <tt>TH1::FillRandom(TH1*,int)</tt>
  when the passed histogram has the same bins. In this case generate
  the flactuations bin by bins using Multinomial statistics
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>THnSparse</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Shrink THnSparse on disk by 70% in an arbitrary example case;
  also reduce memory usage, especially when not filling.
  <br/>
  <b>IMPORTANT NOTE</b>: while new THnSparse objects can be read and e.g. projected from in old ROOT versions, filling a new THnSparse object in old ROOT versions does NOT WORK!</li>
  <li>
  Add SetBinContent(), AddBinContent(), SetBinError() taking the
  linear bin index. Use it in Projection() for a considerable
  speed-up.</li>
</ul>

<h4>TSpectrum2Painter</h4>
<ul>
<li> New parameter bf() in the SPEC option to define the buffer size
  used by TSpectrum2Painter. It is needed in case of very
  large canvases like 8000x5000.</li>
</ul>


<h4>New TEfficiency class</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
This new class from Christian Gumpert (CERN summer student 2010) handles the calculation of efficiencies and their uncertainties. It
provides several statistical methods for calculating frequentist and bayesian
confidence intervals as well as a function for combining several efficiencies.</li>
<li>Example of usage: Creating a <tt>TEfficiency</tt> object
  <ul>
    <li>If you start a new analysis, it is highly recommended to use the TEfficiency class
from the beginning. You can then use one of the constructors for fixed or
variable bin size and your desired dimension. These constructors append the
created TEfficiency object to the current directory. So it will be written
automatically to a file during the next <a
    href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TFile.html#TFile:Write">TFile::Write</a>
    command.</li>
    <li>Example 1: create a twodimensional TEfficiency object with 10
    bins along X and 20 bins along Y:
    <pre>
TEfficiency* pEff = new TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;y;#epsilon",10,0,10,20,-5,5);
</pre>
    </li>
<li>  You can fill the TEfficiency object by calling the <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TEfficiency.html#TEfficiency:Fill">Fill(Bool_t bPassed,Double_t x,Double_t y,Double_t z)</a> method.
   The boolean flag "bPassed" indicates whether the current event is a good
   (both histograms are filled) or not (only <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TEfficiency.html#TEfficiency:fTotalHistogram">fTotalHistogram</a> is filled).
   The variables x,y and z determine the bin which is filled. For lower
   dimensions the z- or even the y-value may be omitted.
    </li>

    <li>You can also set the number of passed or total events for a bin directly by using the SetPassedEvents or SetTotalEvents method.</li>

    <li>If you already have two histograms filled with the number of passed and total
events, you will use the constructor <a href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TEfficiency.html#TEfficiency:TEfficiency%1">TEfficiency(const TH1& passed,const TH1& total)</a>
to construct the TEfficiency object. The histograms "passed" and "total" have
to fullfill the conditions  mentioned in <a
    href="http://root.cern.ch/root/html/TEfficiency.html#TEfficiency:CheckConsistency">CheckConsistency</a>,
    otherwise the construction will fail.
    <li>Example 2: Create TEfficiency from 2 existing histograms:
    <pre>
TEfficiency * pEff = 0;
if (TEfficiency::CheckConsistency(h_pass,h_total))
   pEff = new TEfficiency(h_pass,h_total);
   </pre>
    </li>
</ul>
  </li>

<li>
   The TEfficiency class provides various statistics option based on
  frequentist or Bayesian statistics  to compute
  the confidence interval on the efficiencies. For each statistical
  option a corresponding static function esists taking as parameters
  <tt>n</tt>, the number of total events, <tt>k</tt>, the number of
  passed events and <tt>cl</tt> the desired confidence level and a
  boolean flag specyfing if the upper (or lower) interval boundary
  must be computed. Each statistics option can be set using the method
  <tt>TEfficiency::SetStatisticOption</tt></li>
 <li>The major statistics options are (see <a
  href="http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TEfficiency.html#stat">class
  documentation</a> for a full description and examples):
  <ul>
    <li>Clopper_pearson (default) using the function
    <tt>TEfficiency::ClopperPearson(n, k, cl)</tt>
    </li>

    <li>Bayesian methods using the function
    <tt>TEfficiency::Bayesian(n, k, cl, alpha, beta)</tt>.
    In this case the alpha and beta parameters of the
  beta prior distribution for the efficiency can be specified.
    </li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <li>Merging and combining different TEfficiency objects is
   supported
   (see the <a
  href="http://root.cern.ch/root/htmldoc/TEfficiency.html#cm">class
  documentation</a>):
   </li>
</ul>

<h4>New TKDE class</h4>

<ul>
  <li>New class for Kernel density estimation from Bartolomeu
  Rabacal. The algorithm used is described in "Cranmer KS, <i>Kernel Estimation in High-Energy
   Physics</i>. Computer Physics Communications 136:198-207,2001" -
  e-Print Archive: hep ex/0011057 and more information can be found
  also in "Scott DW, <i>Multivariate Density Estimation. Theory, Practice and Visualization</i>. New York: Wiley",
    and "Jann Ben -, <i>Univariate kernel
  density estimation document for KDENS</i> ".
  </li>

  </ul>

<h4>New TSVDUnfold class</h4>

<tt>TSVDUnfold</tt> implements the singular value decomposition based
unfolding method proposed in <a
href="http://arXiv.org/abs/hep-ph/9509307">NIM A372, 469 (1996)
[hep-ph/9509307]</a>. The regularisation is implemented as
a discrete minimum curvature condition. This minimal implementation of
<tt>TSVDUnfold</tt> provides unfolding of one-dimensional histograms with
equal number of, not necessarily equidistant, bins in the measured and
unfolded distributions. In addition to the unfolding itself,
<tt>TSVDUnfold</tt> provides
<ul>
<li>Propagation of covariance matrices from the measured to the unfolded
spectrum via <tt>GetUnfoldCovMatrix</tt></li>
<li>Evaluation of covariance matrix due to finite statistics in detector
response via <tt>GetAdetCovMatrix</tt></li>
<li>Access to distribution of |d_i| useful for determining the proper
regularisation via <tt>GetD</tt></li>
<li>Access to singular values via <tt>GetSV</tt></li>
</ul>
A toy example for the use of <tt>TSVDUnfold</tt> is included in the math
tutorials (<tt>TSVDUnfoldExample.C</tt>).


<h4>New TH2Poly class</h4>
<tt>TH2Poly</tt> is a 2D Histogram class, inheriting from <tt>TH2</tt>,
allowing to define polygonal bins of arbitary shape.
<p>
Each bin, in a <tt>TH2Poly</tt> histogram, is a <tt>TH2PolyBin</tt> object.
<tt>TH2PolyBin</tt> is a very simple class containing the vertices, stored
as <tt>TGraph</tt>s and <tt>TMultiGraph</tt>s, and the content of the polygonal
bin.
<p>
Bins are defined using one of the <tt>AddBin()</tt> methods. The bins definition
should be done before filling.
<p>
<tt>TH2Poly</tt> implements a partitioning algorithm to speed up bins' filling.
The following very simple macro shows how to build and fill a <tt>TH2Poly</tt>:
<pre>
{
   TH2Poly *h2p = new TH2Poly();

   Double_t x1[] = {0, 5, 5};
   Double_t y1[] = {0, 0, 5};
   Double_t x2[] = {0, -1, -1, 0};
   Double_t y2[] = {0, 0, -1, -1};
   Double_t x3[] = {4, 3, 0, 1, 2.4};
   Double_t y3[] = {4, 3.7, 1, 4.7, 3.5};

   h2p->AddBin(3, x1, y1);
   h2p->AddBin(3, x2, y2);
   h2p->AddBin(3, x3, y3);

   h2p->Fill(   3,    1, 3); // fill bin 1
   h2p->Fill(-0.5, -0.5, 7); // fill bin 2
   h2p->Fill(-0.7, -0.5, 1); // fill bin 2
   h2p->Fill(   1,    3, 5); // fill bin 3
}
</pre>
