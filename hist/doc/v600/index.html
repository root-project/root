<h3>Histogram Libraries</h3>


<h3>THistPainter</h3>
<ul>
<li>
With option COL <tt>TProfile2D</tt> histograms are handled differently because, for this type of 2D
histograms, it is possible to know if an empty bin has been filled or not. So even
if all the bins' contents are positive some empty bins might be painted. And vice versa,
if some bins have a negative content some empty bins might be not painted.
</li>
<li>
With option COLZ the axis attributes were not imported correctly on the palette axis.
</li>
<li>
Make sure the 2D drawing options COL, ARR, CONT and BOX are ignored when used to
plot a 1D histogram. 1D histograms plotted with one of these options is now drawn
with the default 1D plotting option. This is useful when the default option in the
TBrowser is, for instance, COL. Before this change the 1D histogram appeared as blank.
</li>
<li>
New plotting option <tt>"LEGO3"</tt>.cw
 Like the option <tt>"LEGO1"</tt>, the option <tt>"LEGO3"</tt> 
draws a lego plot using the hidden surface removal technique but doesn't draw
the border lines of each individual lego-bar. This is very useful for histograms
having many bins. With such histograms the option <tt>"LEGO1"</tt> gives a black
image because of the border lines. This option also works with stacked legos.
</li>
<li>
Implement in THistPainter::GetObjectInfo the case of TProfile and TProfile2D to print the tooltip information on
each bin. Disable the printing of the bin information for TH3, since it is not currently possible to retrieve the
3d bin number from the pixel coordinate. 
</li>
<li>
Fit parameters with very long name destroyed the stats display. This is now fixed.
<br/>
Example:
<pre>
{
   gStyle->SetOptFit(111);
   TH1F *hist = new TH1F("hist","hist",100,-5,5);
   TF1 *fit = new TF1("fit","gaus",-5,5);
   fit->SetParName(2,"Parameter with very very very very long name");
   hist->FillRandom("gaus",5000);
   hist->Draw();
   hist->Fit(fit);
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>TGraphPainter</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Fix http://root.cern.ch/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=8591.
<br/>
When drawn with option SAME the histogram 1st and last bins might be wrong.
The following macro shows the problem:
<pre>
   {
   TCanvas *c = new TCanvas("c","c",900,900);
   c->Divide (1,2);
   
   TH1D * histo1 = new TH1D ("histo1","histo1",100,0.,100.) ;
   histo1->SetBinContent(51,80.) ;
   
   TH1D * histo2 = new TH1D ("histo2","histo2",100,49.9,51.1) ;  /// not ok
   histo2->SetMinimum(0.) ; histo2->SetMaximum(100.) ;
   
   c->cd(1); gPad->DrawFrame(49.9, 0., 51.1, 100);
   histo1->Draw("same");
   
   Double_t xAxis[4] = {3., 5., 7., 9.};
   TH1D *histo2 = new TH1D("histo","",3, xAxis);
   histo2->SetBinContent(1,2.);
   histo2->SetBinContent(2,4.);
   histo2->SetBinContent(3,3.);
   
   c->cd(2); gPad->DrawFrame(4.,0., 10.,5.);
   histo2->Draw("same");
}
</pre>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TPaletteAxis</h3>
<ul>
<li>
The histogram Z axis title is now painted along the palette axis.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TH2, TH3</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Update Projection methods of both TH2 and TH3 to not return a null pointer when an histogram with the same name already existed and it was not compatible.
Now just set the new correct binning on the previously existing histogram.   
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TGraph2D</h3>
<ul>
<li>
When <tt>GetX(YZ)axis</tt> were called on a <tt>TGraph2D</tt>, the frame limit
and plotting options were changed.
</li>
<li>
Modify the <tt>Clear</tt> function in order to be able to reuse 
a <tt>TGraph2D</tt> after a <tt>Clear</tt> is performed.
</li>
<li>
In <tt>GetHistogram()</tt> the lower and higher axis limits are 
always different.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>TF1</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Implement the possibility to save a <tt>TF1</tt> as C code indenpant from ROOT.
It is enough to save the function as a ".cc" file.
<br/>
Example:
<pre>
root [0] TF1 *f1 = new TF1("f1","x*x",-10,10)
root [1] f1->SaveAs("f1.cc");
Info in &lt;TF1::SaveAs&gt;: cc file: f1.cc has been generated
   root [2] .x f1.cc(9.)
   (double)8.10019368181367980e+01
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
