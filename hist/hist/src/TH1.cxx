<center><h2>The Histogram classes</h2></center>
ROOT supports the following histogram types:
<ul>
  <li>1-D histograms:
   <ul>
         <li>TH1C : histograms with one byte per channel.   Maximum bin content = 127
         <li>TH1S : histograms with one short per channel.  Maximum bin content = 32767
         <li>TH1I : histograms with one int per channel.    Maximum bin content = 2147483647
         <li>TH1F : histograms with one float per channel.  Maximum precision 7 digits
         <li>TH1D : histograms with one double per channel. Maximum precision 14 digits
   </ul>

  <li>2-D histograms:
   <ul>
         <li>TH2C : histograms with one byte per channel.   Maximum bin content = 127
         <li>TH2S : histograms with one short per channel.  Maximum bin content = 32767
         <li>TH2I : histograms with one int per channel.    Maximum bin content = 2147483647
         <li>TH2F : histograms with one float per channel.  Maximum precision 7 digits
         <li>TH2D : histograms with one double per channel. Maximum precision 14 digits
   </ul>

  <li>3-D histograms:
   <ul>
         <li>TH3C : histograms with one byte per channel.   Maximum bin content = 127
         <li>TH3S : histograms with one short per channel.  Maximum bin content = 32767
         <li>TH3I : histograms with one int per channel.    Maximum bin content = 2147483647
         <li>TH3F : histograms with one float per channel.  Maximum precision 7 digits
         <li>TH3D : histograms with one double per channel. Maximum precision 14 digits
   </ul>
  <li>Profile histograms: See classes  TProfile, TProfile2D and TProfile3D.
      Profile histograms are used to display the mean value of Y and its RMS
      for each bin in X. Profile histograms are in many cases an elegant
      replacement of two-dimensional histograms : the inter-relation of two
      measured quantities X and Y can always be visualized by a two-dimensional
      histogram or scatter-plot; If Y is an unknown (but single-valued)
      approximate function of X, this function is displayed by a profile
      histogram with much better precision than by a scatter-plot.
</ul>

All histogram classes are derived from the base class TH1

      The TH*C classes also inherit from the array class TArrayC.
      The TH*S classes also inherit from the array class TArrayS.
      The TH*I classes also inherit from the array class TArrayI.
      The TH*F classes also inherit from the array class TArrayF.
      The TH*D classes also inherit from the array class TArrayD.
</pre>

<h4>Creating histograms</h4>
<p>
     Histograms are created by invoking one of the constructors, e.g.
<pre>
       TH1F *h1 = new TH1F("h1", "h1 title", 100, 0, 4.4);
       TH2F *h2 = new TH2F("h2", "h2 title", 40, 0, 4, 30, -3, 3);
</pre>
<p>  Histograms may also be created by:
  <ul>
      <li> calling the Clone function, see below
      <li> making a projection from a 2-D or 3-D histogram, see below
      <li> reading an histogram from a file
   </ul>
<p>  When an histogram is created, a reference to it is automatically added
     to the list of in-memory objects for the current file or directory.
     This default behaviour can be changed by:
<pre>
       h->SetDirectory(0);          for the current histogram h
       TH1::AddDirectory(kFALSE);   sets a global switch disabling the reference
</pre>
     When the histogram is deleted, the reference to it is removed from
     the list of objects in memory.
     When a file is closed, all histograms in memory associated with this file
     are automatically deleted.

<h4>Fix or variable bin size</h4>

     All histogram types support either fix or variable bin sizes.
     2-D histograms may have fix size bins along X and variable size bins
     along Y or vice-versa. The functions to fill, manipulate, draw or access
     histograms are identical in both cases.
<p>     Each histogram always contains 3 objects TAxis: fXaxis, fYaxis and fZaxis
     To access the axis parameters, do:
<pre>
        TAxis *xaxis = h->GetXaxis(); etc.
        Double_t binCenter = xaxis->GetBinCenter(bin), etc.
</pre>
     See class TAxis for a description of all the access functions.
     The axis range is always stored internally in double precision.

<h4>Convention for numbering bins</h4>

      For all histogram types: nbins, xlow, xup
<pre>
        bin = 0;       underflow bin
        bin = 1;       first bin with low-edge xlow INCLUDED
        bin = nbins;   last bin with upper-edge xup EXCLUDED
        bin = nbins+1; overflow bin
</pre>
<p>      In case of 2-D or 3-D histograms, a "global bin" number is defined.
      For example, assuming a 3-D histogram with (binx, biny, binz), the function
<pre>
        Int_t gbin = h->GetBin(binx, biny, binz);
</pre>
      returns a global/linearized gbin number. This global gbin is useful
      to access the bin content/error information independently of the dimension.
      Note that to access the information other than bin content and errors
      one should use the TAxis object directly with e.g.:
<pre>
         Double_t xcenter = h3->GetZaxis()->GetBinCenter(27);
</pre>
       returns the center along z of bin number 27 (not the global bin)
       in the 3-D histogram h3.

<h4>Alphanumeric Bin Labels</h4>

     By default, an histogram axis is drawn with its numeric bin labels.
     One can specify alphanumeric labels instead with:
<ul>
       <li> call TAxis::SetBinLabel(bin, label);
           This can always be done before or after filling.
           When the histogram is drawn, bin labels will be automatically drawn.
           See example in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/graphs/labels1.C, labels2.C
       <li> call to a Fill function with one of the arguments being a string, e.g.
<pre>
           hist1->Fill(somename, weigth);
           hist2->Fill(x, somename, weight);
           hist2->Fill(somename, y, weight);
           hist2->Fill(somenamex, somenamey, weight);
</pre>
           See example in $ROOTSYS/tutorials/hist/hlabels1.C, hlabels2.C
       <li> via TTree::Draw.
           see for example $ROOTSYS/tutorials/tree/cernstaff.C
<pre>
           tree.Draw("Nation::Division");
</pre>
           where "Nation" and "Division" are two branches of a Tree.
</ul>

<p>     When using the options 2 or 3 above, the labels are automatically
     added to the list (THashList) of labels for a given axis.
     By default, an axis is drawn with the order of bins corresponding
     to the filling sequence. It is possible to reorder the axis

<ul>
          <li>alphabetically
          <li>by increasing or decreasing values
</ul>

<p>     The reordering can be triggered via the TAxis context menu by selecting
     the menu item "LabelsOption" or by calling directly
        TH1::LabelsOption(option, axis) where
<ul>
          <li>axis may be "X", "Y" or "Z"
          <li>option may be:
           <ul>
             <li>"a" sort by alphabetic order
             <li>">" sort by decreasing values
             <li>"<" sort by increasing values
             <li>"h" draw labels horizontal
             <li>"v" draw labels vertical
             <li>"u" draw labels up (end of label right adjusted)
             <li>"d" draw labels down (start of label left adjusted)
           </ul>
</ul>
<p>     When using the option 2 above, new labels are added by doubling the current
     number of bins in case one label does not exist yet.
     When the Filling is terminated, it is possible to trim the number
     of bins to match the number of active labels by calling
<pre>
           TH1::LabelsDeflate(axis) with axis = "X", "Y" or "Z"
</pre>
     This operation is automatic when using TTree::Draw.
     Once bin labels have been created, they become persistent if the histogram
     is written to a file or when generating the C++ code via SavePrimitive.

<h4>Histograms with automatic bins</h4>

     When an histogram is created with an axis lower limit greater or equal
     to its upper limit, the SetBuffer is automatically called with an
     argument fBufferSize equal to fgBufferSize (default value=1000).
     fgBufferSize may be reset via the static function TH1::SetDefaultBufferSize.
     The axis limits will be automatically computed when the buffer will
     be full or when the function BufferEmpty is called.

<h4>Filling histograms</h4>

     An histogram is typically filled with statements like:
<pre>
       h1->Fill(x);
       h1->Fill(x, w); //fill with weight
       h2->Fill(x, y)
       h2->Fill(x, y, w)
       h3->Fill(x, y, z)
       h3->Fill(x, y, z, w)
</pre>
     or via one of the Fill functions accepting names described above.
     The Fill functions compute the bin number corresponding to the given
     x, y or z argument and increment this bin by the given weight.
     The Fill functions return the bin number for 1-D histograms or global
     bin number for 2-D and 3-D histograms.
<p>     If TH1::Sumw2 has been called before filling, the sum of squares of
     weights is also stored.
     One can also increment directly a bin number via TH1::AddBinContent
     or replace the existing content via TH1::SetBinContent.
     To access the bin content of a given bin, do:
<pre>
       Double_t binContent = h->GetBinContent(bin);
</pre>

<p>     By default, the bin number is computed using the current axis ranges.
     If the automatic binning option has been set via
<pre>
       h->SetBit(TH1::kCanRebin);
</pre>
     then, the Fill Function will automatically extend the axis range to
     accomodate the new value specified in the Fill argument. The method
     used is to double the bin size until the new value fits in the range,
     merging bins two by two. This automatic binning options is extensively
     used by the TTree::Draw function when histogramming Tree variables
     with an unknown range.
<p>     This automatic binning option is supported for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D histograms.

     During filling, some statistics parameters are incremented to compute
     the mean value and Root Mean Square with the maximum precision.

<p>     In case of histograms of type TH1C, TH1S, TH2C, TH2S, TH3C, TH3S
     a check is made that the bin contents do not exceed the maximum positive
     capacity (127 or 32767). Histograms of all types may have positive
     or/and negative bin contents.

<h4>Rebinning</h4>

     At any time, an histogram can be rebinned via TH1::Rebin. This function
     returns a new histogram with the rebinned contents.
     If bin errors were stored, they are recomputed during the rebinning.

<h4>Associated errors</h4>

     By default, for each bin, the sum of weights is computed at fill time.
     One can also call TH1::Sumw2 to force the storage and computation
     of the sum of the square of weights per bin.
     If Sumw2 has been called, the error per bin is computed as the
     sqrt(sum of squares of weights), otherwise the error is set equal
     to the sqrt(bin content).
     To return the error for a given bin number, do:
<pre>
        Double_t error = h->GetBinError(bin);
</pre>

<h4>Associated functions</h4>

     One or more object (typically a TF1*) can be added to the list
     of functions (fFunctions) associated to each histogram.
     When TH1::Fit is invoked, the fitted function is added to this list.
     Given an histogram h, one can retrieve an associated function
     with:
<pre>
        TF1 *myfunc = h->GetFunction("myfunc");
</pre>

<h4>Operations on histograms</h4>


     Many types of operations are supported on histograms or between histograms
<ul>
     <li> Addition of an histogram to the current histogram.
     <li> Additions of two histograms with coefficients and storage into the current
       histogram.
     <li> Multiplications and Divisions are supported in the same way as additions.
     <li> The Add, Divide and Multiply functions also exist to add, divide or multiply
       an histogram by a function.
</ul>
     If an histogram has associated error bars (TH1::Sumw2 has been called),
     the resulting error bars are also computed assuming independent histograms.
     In case of divisions, Binomial errors are also supported.
     One can mark a histogram to be an "average" histogram by setting its bit kIsAverage via
       myhist.SetBit(TH1::kIsAverage);
     When adding (see TH1::Add) average histograms, the histograms are averaged and not summed.



<h4>Fitting histograms</h4>

     Histograms (1-D, 2-D, 3-D and Profiles) can be fitted with a user
     specified function via TH1::Fit. When an histogram is fitted, the
     resulting function with its parameters is added to the list of functions
     of this histogram. If the histogram is made persistent, the list of
     associated functions is also persistent. Given a pointer (see above)
     to an associated function myfunc, one can retrieve the function/fit
     parameters with calls such as:
<pre>
       Double_t chi2 = myfunc->GetChisquare();
       Double_t par0 = myfunc->GetParameter(0); value of 1st parameter
       Double_t err0 = myfunc->GetParError(0);  error on first parameter
</pre>

<h4>Projections of histograms</h4>

<p>     One can:
<ul>
      <li> make a 1-D projection of a 2-D histogram or Profile
        see functions TH2::ProjectionX,Y, TH2::ProfileX,Y, TProfile::ProjectionX
      <li> make a 1-D, 2-D or profile out of a 3-D histogram
        see functions TH3::ProjectionZ, TH3::Project3D.
</ul>

<p>     One can fit these projections via:
<pre>
      TH2::FitSlicesX,Y, TH3::FitSlicesZ.
</pre>

<h4>Random Numbers and histograms</h4>

     TH1::FillRandom can be used to randomly fill an histogram using
                    the contents of an existing TF1 function or another
                    TH1 histogram (for all dimensions).
<p>     For example the following two statements create and fill an histogram
     10000 times with a default gaussian distribution of mean 0 and sigma 1:
<pre>
       TH1F h1("h1", "histo from a gaussian", 100, -3, 3);
       h1.FillRandom("gaus", 10000);
</pre>
     TH1::GetRandom can be used to return a random number distributed
                    according the contents of an histogram.

<h4>Making a copy of an histogram</h4>

     Like for any other ROOT object derived from TObject, one can use
     the Clone() function. This makes an identical copy of the original
     histogram including all associated errors and functions, e.g.:
<pre>
       TH1F *hnew = (TH1F*)h->Clone("hnew");
</pre>

<h4>Normalizing histograms</h4>

     One can scale an histogram such that the bins integral is equal to
     the normalization parameter via TH1::Scale(Double_t norm), where norm
     is the desired normalization divided by the integral of the histogram.

<h4>Drawing histograms</h4>

     Histograms are drawn via the THistPainter class. Each histogram has
     a pointer to its own painter (to be usable in a multithreaded program).
     Many drawing options are supported.
     See THistPainter::Paint() for more details.
<p>
    The same histogram can be drawn with different options in different pads.
     When an histogram drawn in a pad is deleted, the histogram is
     automatically removed from the pad or pads where it was drawn.
     If an histogram is drawn in a pad, then filled again, the new status
     of the histogram will be automatically shown in the pad next time
     the pad is updated. One does not need to redraw the histogram.
     To draw the current version of an histogram in a pad, one can use
<pre>
        h->DrawCopy();
</pre>
     This makes a clone (see Clone below) of the histogram. Once the clone
     is drawn, the original histogram may be modified or deleted without
     affecting the aspect of the clone.
<p>
     One can use TH1::SetMaximum() and TH1::SetMinimum() to force a particular
     value for the maximum or the minimum scale on the plot. (For 1-D
     histograms this means the y-axis, while for 2-D histograms these
     functions affect the z-axis).
<p>
     TH1::UseCurrentStyle() can be used to change all histogram graphics
     attributes to correspond to the current selected style.
     This function must be called for each histogram.
     In case one reads and draws many histograms from a file, one can force
     the histograms to inherit automatically the current graphics style
     by calling before gROOT->ForceStyle().


<h4>Setting Drawing histogram contour levels (2-D hists only)</h4>

     By default contours are automatically generated at equidistant
     intervals. A default value of 20 levels is used. This can be modified
     via TH1::SetContour() or TH1::SetContourLevel().
     the contours level info is used by the drawing options "cont", "surf",
     and "lego".

<h4>Setting histogram graphics attributes</h4>

     The histogram classes inherit from the attribute classes:
       TAttLine, TAttFill, and TAttMarker.
     See the member functions of these classes for the list of options.

<h4>Giving titles to the X, Y and Z axis</h4>
<pre>
       h->GetXaxis()->SetTitle("X axis title");
       h->GetYaxis()->SetTitle("Y axis title");
</pre>
     The histogram title and the axis titles can be any TLatex string.
     The titles are part of the persistent histogram.
     It is also possible to specify the histogram title and the axis
     titles at creation time. These titles can be given in the "title"
     parameter. They must be separated by ";":
<pre>
        TH1F* h=new TH1F("h", "Histogram title;X Axis;Y Axis;Z Axis", 100, 0, 1);
</pre>
     Any title can be omitted:

<h4>Saving/Reading histograms to/from a ROOT file</h4>

     The following statements create a ROOT file and store an histogram
     on the file. Because TH1 derives from TNamed, the key identifier on
     the file is the histogram name:
<pre>
        TFile f("histos.root", "new");
        TH1F h1("hgaus", "histo from a gaussian", 100, -3, 3);
        h1.FillRandom("gaus", 10000);
        h1->Write();
</pre>
     To read this histogram in another Root session, do:
<pre>
        TFile f("histos.root");
        TH1F *h = (TH1F*)f.Get("hgaus");
</pre>
     One can save all histograms in memory to the file by:
<pre>
        file->Write();
</pre>

<h4>Miscelaneous operations</h4>

<pre>
        TH1::KolmogorovTest(): statistical test of compatibility in shape
                             between two histograms
        TH1::Smooth() smooths the bin contents of a 1-d histogram
        TH1::Integral() returns the integral of bin contents in a given bin range
        TH1::GetMean(int axis) returns the mean value along axis
        TH1::GetRMS(int axis)  returns the sigma distribution along axis
        TH1::GetEntries() returns the number of entries
        TH1::Reset() resets the bin contents and errors of an histogram

   // Introduction:
   //
   //   A frequently used technique in data analysis is the comparison of
   //   histograms. First suggested by Pearson [1] the Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex test of
   //   homogeneity is used widely for comparing usual (unweighted) histograms.
   //   This paper describes the implementation modified Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex tests
   //   for comparison of weighted and unweighted  histograms and two weighted
   //   histograms [2] as well as usual Pearson's Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex test for
   //   comparison two usual (unweighted) histograms.
   //
   // Overview:
   //
   //   Comparison of two histograms expect hypotheses that two histograms
   //   represent identical distributions. To make a decision p-value should
   //   be calculated. The hypotheses of identity is rejected if the p-value is
   //   lower then some significance level. Traditionally significance levels
   //   0.1, 0.05 and 0.01 are used. The comparison procedure should include an
   //   analysis of the residuals which is often helpful in identifying the
   //   bins of histograms responsible for a significant overall Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex value.
   //   Residuals are the difference between bin contents and expected bin
   //   contents. Most convenient for analysis are the normalized residuals. If
   //   hypotheses of identity are valid then normalized residuals are
   //   approximately independent and identically distributed random variables
   //   having N(0,1) distribution. Analysis of residuals expect test of above
   //   mentioned properties of residuals. Notice that indirectly the analysis
   //   of residuals increase the power of Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex test.
   //
   // Methods of comparison:
   //
   //  Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex test for comparison two (unweighted) histograms:
   //   Let us consider two  histograms with the  same binning and the  number
   //   of bins equal to r. Let us denote the number of events in the ith bin
   //   in the first histogram as ni and as mi in the second one. The total
   //   number of events in the first histogram is equal to:
   //Begin_Latex
   //   N = #sum_{i=1}^{r} n_{i}
   //End_Latex
   //   and
   //Begin_Latex
   //   M = #sum_{i=1}^{r} m_{i}
   //End_Latex
   //   in the second histogram. The hypothesis of identity (homogeneity) [3]
   //   is that the two histograms represent random values with identical
   //   distributions. It is equivalent that there exist r constants p1,...,pr,
   //   such that
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #sum_{i=1}^{r} p_{i}=1
   //End_Latex
   //    and the probability of belonging to the ith bin for some measured value
   //    in both experiments is equal to pi. The number of events in the ith
   //    bin is a random variable with a distribution approximated by a Poisson
   //    probability distribution
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #frac{e^{-Np_{i}}(Np_{i})^{n_{i}}}{n_{i}!}
   //End_Latex
   //   for the first histogram and with distribution
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #frac{e^{-Mp_{i}}(Mp_{i})^{m_{i}}}{m_{i}!}
   //End_Latex
   //   for the second histogram. If the hypothesis of homogeneity is valid,
   //   then the  maximum likelihood estimator of pi, i=1,...,r, is
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #hat{p}_{i}= #frac{n_{i}+m_{i}}{N+M}
   //End_Latex
   //   and then
   //Begin_Latex
   //   X^{2} = #sum_{i=1}^{r}#frac{(n_{i}-N#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{N#hat{p}_{i}} + #sum_{i=1}^{r}#frac{(m_{i}-M#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{M#hat{p}_{i}} = #frac{1}{MN} #sum_{i=1}^{r}#frac{(Mn_{i}-Nm_{i})^{2}}{n_{i}+m_{i}}
   //End_Latex
   //   has approximately a Begin_Latex #chi^{2}_{(r-1)} End_Latex distribution [3].
   //   The comparison procedure can include an analysis of the residuals which
   //   is often helpful in identifying the bins of histograms responsible for
   //   a significant overall Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latexvalue. Most convenient for
   //   analysis are the adjusted (normalized) residuals [4]
   //Begin_Latex
   //   r_{i} = #frac{n_{i}-N#hat{p}_{i}}{#sqrt{N#hat{p}_{i}}#sqrt{(1-N/(N+M))(1-(n_{i}+m_{i})/(N+M))}}
   //End_Latex
   //   If hypotheses of  homogeneity are valid then residuals ri are
   //   approximately independent and identically distributed random variables
   //   having N(0,1) distribution. The application of the Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_latex test has
   //   restrictions related to the value of the expected frequencies Npi,
   //   Mpi, i=1,...,r. A conservative rule formulated in [5] is that all the
   //   expectations must be 1 or greater for both histograms. In practical
   //   cases when expected frequencies are not known the estimated expected
   //   frequencies Begin_Latex M#hat{p}_{i}, N#hat{p}_{i}, i=1,...,r End_Latex  can be used.
   //
   //  Unweighted and weighted histograms comparison:
   //
   //   A simple modification of the ideas described above can be used for the
   //   comparison of the usual (unweighted) and weighted histograms. Let us
   //   denote the number of events in the ith bin in the unweighted
   //   histogram as ni and the common weight of events in the ith bin of the
   //   weighted histogram as wi. The total number of events in the
   //   unweighted histogram is equal to
   //Begin_Latex
   //   N = #sum_{i=1}^{r} n_{i}
   //End_Latex
   //   and the total weight of events in the weighted histogram is equal to
   //Begin_Latex
   //   W = #sum_{i=1}^{r} w_{i}
   //End_Latex
   //   Let us formulate the hypothesis of identity of an unweighted histogram
   //   to a weighted histogram so that there exist r constants p1,...,pr, such
   //   that
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #sum_{i=1}^{r} p_{i} = 1
   //End_Latex
   //   for the unweighted histogram. The weight wi is a random variable with a
   //   distribution approximated by the normal probability distribution
   //   Begin_Latex N(Wp_{i},#sigma_{i}^{2}) End_Latex where Begin_Latex #sigma_{i}^{2} End_Latex is the variance of the weight wi.
   //   If we replace the variance Begin_Latex #sigma_{i}^{2} End_Latex
   //   with estimate Begin_Latex s_{i}^{2} End_Latex (sum of squares of weights of
   //   events in the ith bin) and the hypothesis of identity is valid, then the
   //   maximum likelihood estimator of  pi,i=1,...,r, is
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #hat{p}_{i} = #frac{Ww_{i}-Ns_{i}^{2}+#sqrt{(Ww_{i}-Ns_{i}^{2})^{2}+4W^{2}s_{i}^{2}n_{i}}}{2W^{2}}
   //End_Latex
   //   We may then use the test statistic
   //Begin_Latex
   //   X^{2} = #sum_{i=1}^{r} #frac{(n_{i}-N#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{N#hat{p}_{i}} + #sum_{i=1}^{r} #frac{(w_{i}-W#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{s_{i}^{2}}
   //End_Latex
   //   and it has approximately a Begin_Latex #chi^{2}_{(r-1)} End_Latex distribution [2]. This test, as well
   //   as the original one [3], has a restriction on the expected frequencies. The
   //   expected frequencies recommended for the weighted histogram is more than 25.
   //   The value of the minimal expected frequency can be decreased down to 10 for
   //   the case when the weights of the events are close to constant. In the case
   //   of a weighted histogram if the number of events is unknown, then we can
   //   apply this recommendation for the equivalent number of events as
   //Begin_Latex
   //   n_{i}^{equiv} = #frac{ w_{i}^{2} }{ s_{i}^{2} }
   //End_Latex
   //   The minimal expected frequency for an unweighted histogram must be 1. Notice
   //   that any usual (unweighted) histogram can be considered as a weighted
   //   histogram with events that have constant weights equal to 1.
   //   The variance Begin_Latex z_{i}^{2} End_Latex of the difference between the weight wi
   //   and the estimated expectation value of the weight is approximately equal to:
   //Begin_Latex
   //   z_{i}^{2} = Var(w_{i}-W#hat{p}_{i}) = N#hat{p}_{i}(1-N#hat{p}_{i})#left(#frac{Ws_{i}^{2}}{#sqrt{(Ns_{i}^{2}-w_{i}W)^{2}+4W^{2}s_{i}^{2}n_{i}}}#right)^{2}+#frac{s_{i}^{2}}{4}#left(1+#frac{Ns_{i}^{2}-w_{i}W}{#sqrt{(Ns_{i}^{2}-w_{i}W)^{2}+4W^{2}s_{i}^{2}n_{i}}}#right)^{2}
   //End_Latex
   //   The  residuals
   //Begin_Latex
   //   r_{i} = #frac{w_{i}-W#hat{p}_{i}}{z_{i}}
   //End_Latex
   //   have approximately a normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and standard
   //   deviation  equal to 1.
   //
   //  Two weighted histograms comparison:
   //
   //   Let us denote the common  weight of events of the ith bin in the first
   //   histogram as w1i and as w2i in the second one. The total weight of events
   //   in the first histogram is equal to
   //Begin_Latex
   //   W_{1} = #sum_{i=1}^{r} w_{1i}
   //End_Latex
   //   and
   //Begin_Latex
   //   W_{2} = #sum_{i=1}^{r} w_{2i}
   //End_Latex
   //   in the second histogram. Let us formulate the hypothesis of identity of
   //   weighted histograms so that there exist r constants p1,...,pr, such that
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #sum_{i=1}^{r} p_{i} = 1
   //End_Latex
   //   and also expectation value of weight w1i equal to W1pi and expectation value
   //   of weight w2i equal to W2pi. Weights in both the histograms are random
   //   variables with distributions which can be approximated by a normal
   //   probability distribution Begin_Latex N(W_{1}p_{i},#sigma_{1i}^{2}) End_Latex for the first histogram
   //   and by a distribution Begin_Latex N(W_{2}p_{i},#sigma_{2i}^{2}) End_Latex for the second.
   //   Here Begin_Latex #sigma_{1i}^{2} End_Latex and Begin_Latex #sigma_{2i}^{2} End_Latex are the variances
   //   of w1i and w2i with estimators Begin_Latex s_{1i}^{2} End_Latex and Begin_Latex s_{2i}^{2} End_Latex respectively.
   //   If the hypothesis of identity is valid, then the maximum likelihood and
   //   Least Square Method estimator of pi,i=1,...,r, is
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #hat{p}_{i} = #frac{w_{1i}W_{1}/s_{1i}^{2}+w_{2i}W_{2} /s_{2i}^{2}}{W_{1}^{2}/s_{1i}^{2}+W_{2}^{2}/s_{2i}^{2}}
   //End_Latex
   //   We may then use the test statistic
   //Begin_Latex
   //   X^{2} = #sum_{i=1}^{r} #frac{(w_{1i}-W_{1}#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{s_{1i}^{2}} + #sum_{i=1}^{r} #frac{(w_{2i}-W_{2}#hat{p}_{i})^{2}}{s_{2i}^{2}} = #sum_{i=1}^{r} #frac{(W_{1}w_{2i}-W_{2}w_{1i})^{2}}{W_{1}^{2}s_{2i}^{2}+W_{2}^{2}s_{1i}^{2}}
   //End_Latex
   //   and it has approximately a Begin_Latex #chi^{2}_{(r-1)} End_Latex distribution [2].
   //   The normalized or studentised residuals [6]
   //Begin_Latex
   //   r_{i} = #frac{w_{1i}-W_{1}#hat{p}_{i}}{s_{1i}#sqrt{1 - #frac{1}{(1+W_{2}^{2}s_{1i}^{2}/W_{1}^{2}s_{2i}^{2})}}}
   //End_Latex
   //   have approximately a normal distribution with mean equal to 0 and standard
   //   deviation 1. A recommended minimal expected frequency is equal to 10 for
   //   the proposed test.
   //
   // Numerical examples:
   //
   //   The method described herein is now illustrated with an example.
   //   We take a distribution
   //Begin_Latex
   //   #phi(x) = #frac{2}{(x-10)^{2}+1} + #frac{1}{(x-14)^{2}+1}       (1)
   //End_Latex
   //   defined on the interval [4,16]. Events distributed according to the formula
   //   (1) are simulated to create the unweighted histogram. Uniformly distributed
   //   events are simulated for the weighted histogram with weights calculated by
   //   formula (1). Each histogram has the same number of bins: 20. Fig.1 shows
   //   the result of comparison of the unweighted histogram with 200 events
   //   (minimal expected frequency equal to one) and the weighted histogram with
   //   500 events (minimal expected frequency equal to 25)

   //   and the weighted histogram with 500 events:

   //      b) weighted histogram;
   //      c) normalized residuals plot;
   //      d) normal Q-Q plot of residuals.
   //
   //   The value of the test statistic Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex is equal to
   //   21.09 with p-value equal to 0.33, therefore the hypothesis of identity of
   //   the two histograms can be accepted for 0.05 significant level. The behavior

   //   (see Fig. 1d) of residuals are regular and we cannot identify the outliers
   //   or bins with a big influence on Begin_Latex #chi^{2} End_Latex.

   //   to content of bin number 15 in unweighted histogram. Fig.2 shows the result

//  transform object.
//
// Parameters:
//  1st - histogram for the output. If a null pointer is passed, a new histogram is created
//  and returned, otherwise, the provided histogram is used and should be big enough
//
//  Options: option parameters consists of 3 parts:
//    - option on what to return
//   "RE" - returns a histogram of the real part of the output
//   "IM" - returns a histogram of the imaginary part of the output
//   "MAG"- returns a histogram of the magnitude of the output
//   "PH" - returns a histogram of the phase of the output
//
//    - option of transform type
//   "R2C"  - real to complex transforms - default
//   "R2HC" - real to halfcomplex (special format of storing output data,
//          results the same as for R2C)
//   "DHT" - discrete Hartley transform
//         real to real transforms (sine and cosine):
//   "R2R_0", "R2R_1", "R2R_2", "R2R_3" - discrete cosine transforms of types I-IV
//   "R2R_4", "R2R_5", "R2R_6", "R2R_7" - discrete sine transforms of types I-IV
//    To specify the type of each dimension of a 2-dimensional real to real
//    transform, use options of form "R2R_XX", for example, "R2R_02" for a transform,
//    which is of type "R2R_0" in 1st dimension and  "R2R_2" in the 2nd.
//
//    - option of transform flag
//    "ES" (from "estimate") - no time in preparing the transform, but probably sub-optimal
//       performance
//    "M" (from "measure")   - some time spend in finding the optimal way to do the transform
//    "P" (from "patient")   - more time spend in finding the optimal way to do the transform
//    "EX" (from "exhaustive") - the most optimal way is found
//     This option should be chosen depending on how many transforms of the same size and
//     type are going to be done. Planning is only done once, for the first transform of this
//     size and type. Default is "ES".

//

//         option = "W"  Set all weights to 1 for non empty bins; ignore error bars
//                = "WW" Set all weights to 1 including empty bins; ignore error bars
//                = "I"  Use integral of function in bin, normalized by the bin volume,
//                       instead of value at bin center
//                = "L"  Use Loglikelihood method (default is chisquare method)
//                = "WL" Use Loglikelihood method and bin contents are not integer,
//                       i.e. histogram is weighted (must have Sumw2() set)
//                = "U"  Use a User specified fitting algorithm (via SetFCN)
//                = "Q"  Quiet mode (minimum printing)
//                = "V"  Verbose mode (default is between Q and V)
//                = "E"  Perform better Errors estimation using Minos technique
//                = "B"  User defined parameter settings are used for predefined functions
//                       like "gaus", "expo", "poln", "landau".
//                       Use this option when you want to fix one or more parameters for these functions.
//                = "M"  More. Improve fit results.
//                       It uses the IMPROVE command of TMinuit (see TMinuit::mnimpr).
//                       This algorithm attempts to improve the found local minimum by searching for a
//                       better one.
//                = "R"  Use the Range specified in the function range
//                = "N"  Do not store the graphics function, do not draw
//                = "0"  Do not plot the result of the fit. By default the fitted function
//                       is drawn unless the option"N" above is specified.
//                = "+"  Add this new fitted function to the list of fitted functions
//                       (by default, any previous function is deleted)
//                = "C"  In case of linear fitting, don't calculate the chisquare
//                       (saves time)
//                = "F"  If fitting a polN, switch to minuit fitter
//                = "S"  The result of the fit is returned in the TFitResultPtr
//                       (see below Access to the Fit Result)
//
//      When the fit is drawn (by default), the parameter goption may be used
//      to specify a list of graphics options. See TH1::Draw for a complete
//      list of these options.
//
//      In order to use the Range option, one must first create a function
//      with the expression to be fitted. For example, if your histogram
//      has a defined range between -4 and 4 and you want to fit a gaussian
//      only in the interval 1 to 3, you can do:
//           TF1 *f1 = new TF1("f1", "gaus", 1, 3);
//           histo->Fit("f1", "R");
//
//      Setting initial conditions
//      ==========================
//      Parameters must be initialized before invoking the Fit function.
//      The setting of the parameter initial values is automatic for the
//      predefined functions : poln, expo, gaus, landau. One can however disable
//      this automatic computation by specifying the option "B".
//      Note that if a predefined function is defined with an argument,
//      eg, gaus(0), expo(1), you must specify the initial values for
//      the parameters.
//      You can specify boundary limits for some or all parameters via
//           f1->SetParLimits(p_number, parmin, parmax);
//      if parmin>=parmax, the parameter is fixed
//      Note that you are not forced to fix the limits for all parameters.
//      For example, if you fit a function with 6 parameters, you can do:
//        func->SetParameters(0, 3.1, 1.e-6, -8, 0, 100);
//        func->SetParLimits(3, -10, -4);
//        func->FixParameter(4, 0);
//        func->SetParLimits(5, 1, 1);
//      With this setup, parameters 0->2 can vary freely
//      Parameter 3 has boundaries [-10,-4] with initial value -8
//      Parameter 4 is fixed to 0
//      Parameter 5 is fixed to 100.
//      When the lower limit and upper limit are equal, the parameter is fixed.
//      However to fix a parameter to 0, one must call the FixParameter function.
//
//      Note that option "I" gives better results but is slower.
//
//
//      Changing the fitting objective function
//      =============================
//     By default a chi square function is used for fitting. When option "L" (or "LL") is used
//     a Poisson likelihood function (see note below) is used.
//     The functions are defined in the header Fit/Chi2Func.h or Fit/PoissonLikelihoodFCN and they
//     are implemented using the routines FitUtil::EvaluateChi2 or FitUtil::EvaluatePoissonLogL in
//     the file math/mathcore/src/FitUtil.cxx.
//     To specify a User defined fitting function, specify option "U" and
//     call the following functions:
//       TVirtualFitter::Fitter(myhist)->SetFCN(MyFittingFunction)
//     where MyFittingFunction is of type:
//     extern void MyFittingFunction(Int_t &npar, Double_t *gin, Double_t &f, Double_t *u, Int_t flag);
//
//     Likelihood Fits
//     =================
//     When using option "L" a likelihood fit is used instead of the default chi2 square fit.
//     The likelihood is built assuming a Poisson probability density function for each bin.
//     This method can then be used only when the bin content represents counts (i.e. errors are sqrt(N) ).
//     The likelihood method has the advantage of treating correctly the empty bins and use them in the
//     fit procedure.
//     In the chi2 method the empty bins are skipped and not considered in the fit.
//     The likelihood method, although a bit slower, it is the recommended method in case of low
//     bin statistics, where the chi2 method may give incorrect results.
//
//      Fitting a histogram of dimension N with a function of dimension N-1
//      ===================================================================
//     It is possible to fit a TH2 with a TF1 or a TH3 with a TF2.
//     In this case the option "Integral" is not allowed and each cell has
//     equal weight.
//
//     Associated functions
//     ====================
//     One or more object (typically a TF1*) can be added to the list
//     of functions (fFunctions) associated to each histogram.
//     When TH1::Fit is invoked, the fitted function is added to this list.
//     Given an histogram h, one can retrieve an associated function
//     with:  TF1 *myfunc = h->GetFunction("myfunc");
//
//      Access to the fit result
//      ========================
//     The function returns a TFitResultPtr which can hold a  pointer to a TFitResult object.
//     By default the TFitResultPtr contains only the status of the fit which is return by an
//     automatic conversion of the TFitResultPtr to an integer. One can write in this case directly:
//     Int_t fitStatus =  h->Fit(myFunc)
//
//     If the option "S" is instead used, TFitResultPtr contains the TFitResult and behaves as a smart
//     pointer to it. For example one can do:
//     TFitResultPtr r = h->Fit(myFunc,"S");
//     TMatrixDSym cov = r->GetCovarianceMatrix();  //  to access the covariance matrix
//     Double_t chi2   = r->Chi2(); // to retrieve the fit chi2
//     Double_t par0   = r->Parameter(0); // retrieve the value for the parameter 0
//     Double_t err0   = r->ParError(0); // retrieve the error for the parameter 0
//     r->Print("V");     // print full information of fit including covariance matrix
//     r->Write();        // store the result in a file
//
//     The fit parameters, error and chi2 (but not covariance matrix) can be retrieved also
//     from the fitted function.
//     If the histogram is made persistent, the list of
//     associated functions is also persistent. Given a pointer (see above)
//     to an associated function myfunc, one can retrieve the function/fit
//     parameters with calls such as:
//       Double_t chi2 = myfunc->GetChisquare();
//       Double_t par0 = myfunc->GetParameter(0); //value of 1st parameter
//       Double_t err0 = myfunc->GetParError(0);  //error on first parameter
//
//
//     Access to the fit status
//     =====================
//     The status of the fit can be obtained converting the TFitResultPtr to an integer
//     independently if the fit option "S" is used or not:
//     TFitResultPtr r = h->Fit(myFunc,opt);
//     Int_t fitStatus = r;
//
//     The fitStatus is 0 if the fit is OK (i.e no error occurred).
//     The value of the fit status code is negative in case of an error not connected with the
//     minimization procedure, for example  when a wrong function is used.
//     Otherwise the return value is the one returned from the minimization procedure.
//     When TMinuit (default case) or Minuit2 are used as minimizer the status returned is :
//     fitStatus =  migradResult + 10*minosResult + 100*hesseResult + 1000*improveResult.
//     TMinuit will return 0 (for migrad, minos, hesse or improve) in case of success and 4 in
//     case of error (see the documentation of TMinuit::mnexcm). So for example, for an error
//     only in Minos but not in Migrad a fitStatus of 40 will be returned.
//     Minuit2 will return also 0 in case of success and different values in migrad minos or
//     hesse depending on the error. See in this case the documentation of
//     Minuit2Minimizer::Minimize for the migradResult, Minuit2Minimizer::GetMinosError for the
//     minosResult and Minuit2Minimizer::Hesse for the hesseResult.
//     If other minimizers are used see their specific documentation for the status code returned.
//     For example in the case of Fumili, for the status returned see TFumili::Minimize.
//
//      Excluding points
//      ================
//     Use TF1::RejectPoint inside your fitting function to exclude points
//     within a certain range from the fit. Example:
//     Double_t fline(Double_t *x, Double_t *par)
//     {
//         if (x[0] > 2.5 && x[0] < 3.5) {
//           TF1::RejectPoint();
//           return 0;
//        }
//        return par[0] + par[1]*x[0];
//     }
//
//     void exclude() {
//        TF1 *f1 = new TF1("f1", "[0] +[1]*x +gaus(2)", 0, 5);
//        f1->SetParameters(6, -1,5, 3, 0.2);
//        TH1F *h = new TH1F("h", "background + signal", 100, 0, 5);
//        h->FillRandom("f1", 2000);
//        TF1 *fline = new TF1("fline", fline, 0, 5, 2);
//        fline->SetParameters(2, -1);
//        h->Fit("fline", "l");
//     }
//
//      Warning when using the option "0"
//      =================================
//     When selecting the option "0", the fitted function is added to
//     the list of functions of the histogram, but it is not drawn.
//     You can undo what you disabled in the following way:
//       h.Fit("myFunction", "0"); // fit, store function but do not draw
//       h.Draw(); function is not drawn
//       const Int_t kNotDraw = 1<<9;
//       h.GetFunction("myFunction")->ResetBit(kNotDraw);
//       h.Draw();  // function is visible again
//
//      Access to the Minimizer information during fitting
//      ===============================================
//     This function calls, the ROOT::Fit::FitObject function implemented in HFitImpl.cxx
//     which uses the ROOT::Fit::Fitter class. The Fitter class creates the objective fuction
//     (e.g. chi2 or likelihood) and uses an implementation of the  Minimizer interface for minimizing
//     the function.
//     The default minimizer is Minuit (class TMinuitMinimizer which calls TMinuit).
//     The default  can be set in the resource file in etc/system.rootrc. For example
//     Root.Fitter:      Minuit2
//     A different fitter can also be set via ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer
//     (or TVirtualFitter::SetDefaultFitter).
//     For example ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer("GSLMultiMin","BFGS");
//     will set the usdage of the BFGS algorithm of the GSL multi-dimensional minimization
//     (implemented in libMathMore). ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions can be used also to set other
//     default options, like maximum number of function calls, minimization tolerance or print
//     level. See the documentation of this class.
//
//     For fitting linear functions (containing the "++" sign" and polN functions,
//     the linear fitter is automatically initialized.

   //  NOTE3 (Jan Conrad, Fred James)
   //  "The returned value PROB is calculated such that it will be
   //  uniformly distributed between zero and one for compatible histograms,
   //  provided the data are not binned (or the number of bins is very large
   //  compared with the number of events). Users who have access to unbinned
   //  data and wish exact confidence levels should therefore not put their data
   //  into histograms, but should call directly TMath::KolmogorovTest. On
   //  the other hand, since TH1 is a convenient way of collecting data and
   //  saving space, this function has been provided. However, the values of
   //  PROB for binned data will be shifted slightly higher than expected,
   //  depending on the effects of the binning. For example, when comparing two
   //  uniform distributions of 500 events in 100 bins, the values of PROB,
   //  instead of being exactly uniformly distributed between zero and one, have
   //  a mean value of about 0.56. We can apply a useful
   //  rule: As long as the bin width is small compared with any significant
   //  physical effect (for example the experimental resolution) then the binning
   //  cannot have an important effect. Therefore, we believe that for all
   //  practical purposes, the probability value PROB is calculated correctly
   //  provided the user is aware that:
   //     1. The value of PROB should not be expected to have exactly the correct
   //  distribution for binned data.
   //     2. The user is responsible for seeing to it that the bin widths are
   //  small compared with any physical phenomena of interest.
   //     3. The effect of binning (if any) is always to make the value of PROB
   //  slightly too big. That is, setting an acceptance criterion of (PROB>0.05
   //  will assure that at most 5% of truly compatible histograms are rejected,
   //  and usually somewhat less."
   //
   //  Note also that for GoF test of unbinned data ROOT provides also the class
   //  ROOT::Math::GoFTest. The class has also method for doing one sample tests
   //  (i.e. comparing the data with a given distribution).
