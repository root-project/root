/** \class TEfficiency
    \ingroup Hist
    \brief Class to handle efficiency histograms

## I. Overview
This class handles the calculation of efficiencies and their uncertainties. It
provides several statistical methods for calculating frequentist and Bayesian
confidence intervals as well as a function for combining several efficiencies.

Efficiencies have a lot of applications and meanings but in principle, they can
be described by the fraction of good/passed events k out of sample containing
N events. One is usually interested in the dependency of the efficiency on other
(binned) variables. The number of passed and total events is therefore stored
internally in two histograms (TEfficiency::fTotalHistogram and TEfficiency::fPassedHistogram).
Then the efficiency, as well as its upper and lower error, can be calculated for each bin
individually.

As the efficiency can be regarded as a parameter of a binomial distribution, the
number of passed and total events must always be integer numbers. Therefore a
filling with weights is not possible. However, you can assign a global weight to each
TEfficiency object (TEfficiency::SetWeight).
It is necessary to create one TEfficiency object
for each weight if you investigate a process involving different weights. This
procedure needs more effort but enables you to re-use the filled object in cases
where you want to change one or more weights. This would not be possible if all
events with different weights were filled in the same histogram.

## II. Creating a TEfficiency object
If you start a new analysis, it is highly recommended to use the TEfficiency class
from the beginning. You can then use one of the constructors for fixed or
variable bin size and your desired dimension. These constructors append the
created TEfficiency object to the current directory. So it will be written
automatically to a file during the next TFile::Write command.

Example: create a two-dimensional TEfficiency object with
- name = "eff"
- title = "my efficiency"
- axis titles: x, y and LaTeX-formatted epsilon as a label for Z axis
- 10 bins with constant bin width (= 1) along X axis starting at 0 (lower edge
  from the first bin) up to 10 (upper edge of last bin)
- 20 bins with constant bin width (= 0.5) along Y axis starting at -5 (lower
  edge from the first bin) up to 5 (upper edge of last bin)

        TEfficiency* pEff = new TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;y;#epsilon",10,0,10,20,-5,5);

If you already have two histograms filled with the number of passed and total
events, you will use the constructor TEfficiency(const TH1& passed,const TH1& total)
to construct the TEfficiency object. The histograms "passed" and "total" have
to fulfill the conditions mentioned in TEfficiency::CheckConsistency, otherwise the construction will fail.
As the histograms already exist, the new TEfficiency is by default **not** attached
to the current directory to avoid duplication of data. If you want to store the
new object anyway, you can either write it directly by calling TObject::Write or attach it to a directory using TEfficiency::SetDirectory.
This also applies to TEfficiency objects created by the copy constructor TEfficiency::TEfficiency(const TEfficiency& rEff).


### Example 1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TEfficiency* pEff = 0;
TFile* pFile = new TFile("myfile.root","recreate");

//h_pass and h_total are valid and consistent histograms
if(TEfficiency::CheckConsistency(h_pass,h_total))
{
  pEff = new TEfficiency(h_pass,h_total);
  // this will write the TEfficiency object to "myfile.root"
  // AND pEff will be attached to the current directory
  pEff->Write();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

### Example 2

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
TEfficiency* pEff = 0;
TFile* pFile = new TFile("myfile.root","recreate");

//h_pass and h_total are valid and consistent histograms
if(TEfficiency::CheckConsistency(h_pass,h_total))
{
  pEff = new TEfficiency(h_pass,h_total);
  //this will attach the TEfficiency object to the current directory
  pEff->SetDirectory(gDirectory);
  //now all objects in gDirectory will be written to "myfile.root"
  pFile->Write();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you already have two filled histograms and you only want to
plot them as a graph, you should rather use TGraphAsymmErrors::TGraphAsymmErrors(const TH1* pass,const TH1* total,Option_t* opt)
to create a graph object.

## III. Filling with events
You can fill the TEfficiency object by calling the TEfficiency::Fill(Bool_t bPassed,Double_t x,Double_t y,Double_t z) method.
The "bPassed" boolean flag indicates whether the current event is good
(both histograms are filled) or not (only TEfficiency::fTotalHistogram is filled).
The x, y and z variables determine the bin which is filled. For lower dimensions, the z- or even the y-value may be omitted.

Begin_Macro(source)
{
   //canvas only needed for this documentation
   TCanvas* c1 = new TCanvas("example","",600,400);
   c1->SetFillStyle(1001);
   c1->SetFillColor(kWhite);

   //create one-dimensional TEfficiency object with fixed bin size
   TEfficiency* pEff = new TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;#epsilon",20,0,10);
   TRandom3 rand3;

   bool bPassed;
   double x;
   for(int i=0; i<10000; ++i)
   {
      //simulate events with variable under investigation
      x = rand3.Uniform(10);
      //check selection: bPassed = DoesEventPassSelection(x)
      bPassed = rand3.Rndm() < TMath::Gaus(x,5,4);
      pEff->Fill(bPassed,x);
   }

   pEff->Draw("AP");

   //only for this documentation
   return c1;
}
End_Macro

You can also set the number of passed or total events for a bin directly by
using the TEfficiency::SetPassedEvents or TEfficiency::SetTotalEvents method.

## IV. Statistic options
The calculation of the estimated efficiency depends on the chosen statistic
option. Let k denotes the number of passed events and N the number of total
events.

###Frequentist methods
The expectation value of the number of passed events is given by the true
efficiency times the total number of events. One can estimate the efficiency
by replacing the expected number of passed events by the observed number of
passed events.

\f[
      k = \epsilon \times N    \Rightarrow    \hat{\varepsilon} = \frac{k}{N}
\f]

### Bayesian methods
In Bayesian statistics a likelihood-function (how probable is it to get the
observed data assuming a true efficiency) and a prior probability (what is the
probability that a certain true efficiency is actually realised) are used to
determine a posterior probability by using Bayes theorem. At the moment, only
beta distributions (have 2 free parameters) are supported as prior
probabilities.

\f{eqnarray*}{
 P(\epsilon | k ; N) &=& \frac{1}{norm} \times P(k | \epsilon ; N) \times Prior(\epsilon) \\
 P(k | \epsilon ; N) &=& Binomial(N,k) \times \epsilon^{k} \times (1 - \epsilon)^{N - k} ...\  binomial\ distribution \\
 Prior(\epsilon) &=& \frac{1}{B(\alpha,\beta)} \times \epsilon ^{\alpha - 1} \times (1 - \epsilon)^{\beta - 1} \equiv Beta(\epsilon; \alpha,\beta) \\
 \Rightarrow P(\epsilon | k ; N) &=& \frac{1}{norm'} \times \epsilon^{k + \alpha - 1} \times (1 - \epsilon)^{N - k + \beta - 1} \equiv Beta(\epsilon; k + \alpha, N - k + \beta)
\f}

By default the expectation value of this posterior distribution is used as an estimator for the efficiency:

\f[
      \hat{\varepsilon} = \frac{k + \alpha}{N + \alpha + \beta}
\f]

Optionally the mode can also be used as a value for the estimated efficiency. This can be done by calling
SetBit(kPosteriorMode) or TEfficiency::SetPosteriorMode. In this case, the estimated efficiency is:

\f[
       \hat{\varepsilon} = \frac{k + \alpha -1}{N + \alpha + \beta - 2}
\f]

In the case of a uniform prior distribution, B(x,1,1), the posterior mode is k/n, equivalent to the frequentist
estimate (the maximum likelihood value).

The statistic options also specify which confidence interval is used for calculating
the uncertainties of the efficiency. The following properties define the error
calculation:
- **fConfLevel:** desired confidence level: 0 < fConfLevel < 1 (TEfficiency::GetConfidenceLevel / TEfficiency::SetConfidenceLevel)
- **fStatisticOption** defines which method is used to calculate the boundaries of the confidence interval (TEfficiency::SetStatisticOption)
- **fBeta_alpha, fBeta_beta:** parameters for the prior distribution which is only used in the bayesian case (TEfficiency::GetBetaAlpha / TEfficiency::GetBetaBeta / TEfficiency::SetBetaAlpha / TEfficiency::SetBetaBeta)
- **kIsBayesian:** flag whether bayesian statistics are used or not (TEfficiency::UsesBayesianStat)
- **kShortestInterval:** flag whether shortest interval (instead of central one) are used in case of Bayesian statistics  (TEfficiency::UsesShortestInterval). Normally shortest interval should be used in combination with the mode (see TEfficiency::UsesPosteriorMode)
- **fWeight:** global weight for this TEfficiency object which is used during combining or merging with other TEfficiency objects(TEfficiency::GetWeight / TEfficiency::SetWeight)

In the following table, the implemented confidence intervals are listed
with their corresponding statistic option. For more details on the calculation,
please have a look at the mentioned functions.

The prior probability of the efficiency in Bayesian statistics can be given
in terms of a beta distribution. The beta distribution has two positive shape
parameters. The resulting priors for different combinations of these shape
parameters are shown in the plot below.

## V. Merging and combining TEfficiency objects
In many applications, the efficiency should be calculated for an inhomogeneous
sample in the sense that it contains events with different weights. In order
to be able to determine the correct overall efficiency, it is necessary to
use for each subsample (= all events with the same weight) a different
TEfficiency object. After finishing your analysis you can then construct the
overall efficiency with its uncertainty.

This procedure has the advantage that you can change the weight of one
subsample easily without rerunning the whole analysis. On the other hand, more
effort is needed to handle several TEfficiency objects instead of one
histogram. In the case of many different or even continuously distributed
weights, this approach becomes cumbersome. One possibility to overcome this
problem is the usage of binned weights.

### Example
In particle physics weights arises from the fact that you want to
normalise your results to a certain reference value. A very common formula for
calculating weights is

\f{eqnarray*}{
   w &=& \frac{\sigma L}{N_{gen} \epsilon_{trig}} \\
     &-& \sigma ...\ cross\ section \\
     &-& L ...\ luminosity \\
     &-& N_{gen}\ ... number\ of\ generated\ events \\
     &-& \epsilon_{trig}\ ...\ (known)\ trigger\ efficiency \\
\f}

The reason for different weights can therefore be:
- different processes
- other integrated luminosity
- varying trigger efficiency
- different sample sizes
- ...
- or even combination of them

Depending on the actual meaning of different weights in your case, you
should either merge or combine them to get the overall efficiency.

### V.1 When should I use merging?
If the weights are artificial and do not represent real alternative hypotheses,
you should merge the different TEfficiency objects. That means especially for
the Bayesian case that the prior probability should be the same for all merged
TEfficiency objects. The merging can be done by invoking one of the following
operations:
- eff1.Add(eff2)
- eff1 += eff2
- eff1 = eff1 + eff2

The result of the merging is stored in the TEfficiency object which is marked
bold above. The contents of the internal histograms of both TEfficiency
objects are added and a new weight is assigned. The statistic options are not
changed.

\f[
   \frac{1}{w_{new}} = \frac{1}{w_{1}} + \frac{1}{w_{2}}
\f]

### Example:
If you use two samples with different numbers of generated events for the same
process and you want to normalise both to the same integrated luminosity and
trigger efficiency, the different weights then arise just from the fact that
you have different numbers of events. The TEfficiency objects should be merged
because the samples do not represent true alternatives. You expect the same
result as if you would have a big sample with all events in it.

\f[
   w_{1} = \frac{\sigma L}{\epsilon N_{1}}, w_{2} = \frac{\sigma L}{\epsilon N_{2}} \Rightarrow w_{new} = \frac{\sigma L}{\epsilon (N_{1} + N_{2})} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{w_{1}} + \frac{1}{w_{2}}}
\f]

### V.2 When should I use combining?
You should combine TEfficiency objects whenever the weights represent
alternatives processes for the efficiency. As the combination of two TEfficiency
objects is not always consistent with the representation by two internal
histograms, the result is not stored in a TEfficiency object but a TGraphAsymmErrors
is returned which shows the estimated combined efficiency and its uncertainty
for each bin.
At the moment the combination method TEfficiency::Combine only supports a combination of 1-dimensional
efficiencies in a Bayesian approach.


For calculating the combined efficiency and its uncertainty for each bin only Bayesian statistics
is used. No frequentists methods are presently supported for computing the combined efficiency and
its confidence interval.
In the case of the Bayesian statistics, a combined posterior is constructed taking into account the
weight of each TEfficiency object. The same prior is used for all the TEfficiency objects.

\f{eqnarray*}{
  P_{comb}(\epsilon | {w_{i}}, {k_{i}} , {N_{i}}) = \frac{1}{norm} \prod_{i}{L(k_{i} | N_{i}, \epsilon)}^{w_{i}} \Pi( \epsilon )\\
L(k_{i} | N_{i}, \epsilon)\ is\ the\ likelihood\ function\ for\ the\ sample\ i\ (a\ Binomial\ distribution)\\
\Pi( \epsilon)\ is\ the\ prior,\ a\ beta\ distribution\ B(\epsilon, \alpha, \beta).\\
The\ resulting\ combined\ posterior\ is \\
P_{comb}(\epsilon |{w_{i}}; {k_{i}}; {N_{i}}) = B(\epsilon, \sum_{i}{ w_{i} k_{i}} + \alpha, \sum_{i}{ w_{i}(n_{i}-k_{i})}+\beta) \\
\hat{\varepsilon} = \int_{0}^{1} \epsilon \times P_{comb}(\epsilon | {k_{i}} , {N_{i}}) d\epsilon \\
confidence\ level = 1 - \alpha \\
\frac{\alpha}{2} = \int_{0}^{\epsilon_{low}} P_{comb}(\epsilon | {k_{i}} , {N_{i}}) d\epsilon ...\ defines\ lower\ boundary \\
1- \frac{\alpha}{2} = \int_{0}^{\epsilon_{up}} P_{comb}(\epsilon | {k_{i}} , {N_{i}}) d\epsilon ...\ defines\ upper\ boundary
\f}


###Example:
If you use cuts to select electrons which can originate from two different
processes, you can determine the selection efficiency for each process. The
overall selection efficiency is then the combined efficiency. The weights to be used in the
combination should be the probability that an
electron comes from the corresponding process.

\f[
p_{1} = \frac{\sigma_{1}}{\sigma_{1} + \sigma_{2}} = \frac{N_{1}w_{1}}{N_{1}w_{1} + N_{2}w_{2}}\\
p_{2} = \frac{\sigma_{2}}{\sigma_{1} + \sigma_{2}} = \frac{N_{2}w_{2}}{N_{1}w_{1} + N_{2}w_{2}}
\f]

## VI. Further operations

### VI.Information about the internal histograms
The methods TEfficiency::GetPassedHistogram and TEfficiency::GetTotalHistogram
return a constant pointer to the internal histograms. They can be used to
obtain information about the internal histograms (e.g., the binning, number of passed / total events in a bin, mean values...).
One can obtain a clone of the internal histograms by calling TEfficiency::GetCopyPassedHisto or TEfficiency::GetCopyTotalHisto.
The returned histograms are completely independent from the current
TEfficiency object. By default, they are not attached to a directory to
avoid the duplication of data and the user is responsible for deleting them.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
//open a root file which contains a TEfficiency object
TFile* pFile = new TFile("myfile.root","update");

//get TEfficiency object with name "my_eff"
TEfficiency* pEff = (TEfficiency*)pFile->Get("my_eff");

//get clone of total histogram
TH1* clone = pEff->GetCopyTotalHisto();

//change clone...
//save changes of clone directly
clone->Write();
//or append it to the current directory and write the file
//clone->SetDirectory(gDirectory);
//pFile->Write();

//delete histogram object
delete clone;
clone = 0;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to set the internal total or passed histogram by using the
methods TEfficiency::SetPassedHistogram or TEfficiency::SetTotalHistogram.

In order to ensure the validity of the TEfficiency object, the consistency of the
new histogram and the stored histogram is checked. It might be
impossible sometimes to change the histograms in a consistent way. Therefore one can force
the replacement by passing the "f" option. Then the user has to ensure that the
other internal histogram is replaced as well and that the TEfficiency object is
in a valid state.

### VI.2 Fitting
The efficiency can be fitted using the TEfficiency::Fit function which internally uses
the TBinomialEfficiencyFitter::Fit method.
As this method is using a maximum-likelihood-fit, it is necessary to initialise
the given fit function with reasonable start values.
The resulting fit function is attached to the list of associated functions and
will be drawn automatically during the next TEfficiency::Draw command.
The list of associated function can be modified by using the pointer returned
by TEfficiency::GetListOfFunctions.

Begin_Macro(source)
{
   //canvas only needed for this documentation
   TCanvas* c1 = new TCanvas("example","",600,400);
   c1->SetFillStyle(1001);
   c1->SetFillColor(kWhite);

   //create one-dimensional TEfficiency object with fixed bin size
   TEfficiency* pEff = new TEfficiency("eff","my efficiency;x;#epsilon",20,0,10);
   TRandom3 rand3;

   bool bPassed;
   double x;
   for(int i=0; i<10000; ++i)
   {
      //simulate events with variable under investigation
      x = rand3.Uniform(10);
      //check selection: bPassed = DoesEventPassSelection(x)
      bPassed = rand3.Rndm() < TMath::Gaus(x,5,4);
      pEff->Fill(bPassed,x);
   }

   //create a function for fitting and do the fit
   TF1* f1 = new TF1("f1","gaus",0,10);
   f1->SetParameters(1,5,2);
   pEff->Fit(f1);

   //create a threshold function
   TF1* f2 = new TF1("thres","0.8",0,10);
   f2->SetLineColor(kRed);
   //add it to the list of functions
   //use add first because the parameters of the last function will be displayed
   pEff->GetListOfFunctions()->AddFirst(f2);

   pEff->Draw("AP");

   //only for this documentation
   return c1;
}
End_Macro

### VI.3 Draw a TEfficiency object
A TEfficiency object can be drawn by calling the usual TEfficiency::Draw method.
At the moment drawing is only supported for 1- and 2-dimensional TEfficiency objects.
In the 1-dimensional case, you can use the same options as for the TGraphAsymmErrors::Draw
method. For 2-dimensional TEfficiency objects, you can pass the same options as
for a TH2::Draw object.

           - true  - upper boundary is returned
           - false - lower boundary is returned
\param[in] bShortest ??

Note: In the case central confidence interval is calculated.
     when passed = 0 (or passed = total) the lower (or upper)
     interval values will be larger than 0 (or smaller than 1).

Calculation:

The posterior probability in bayesian statistics is given by:
\f[
   P(\varepsilon |k,N) \propto L(\varepsilon|k,N) \times Prior(\varepsilon)
\f]
As an efficiency can be interpreted as probability of a positive outcome of
a Bernoullli trial the likelihood function is given by the binomial
distribution:
\f[
  L(\varepsilon|k,N) = Binomial(N,k) \varepsilon ^{k} (1 - \varepsilon)^{N-k}
\f]
At the moment only beta distributions are supported as prior probabilities
of the efficiency (\f$ B(\alpha,\beta)\f$ is the beta function):
\f[
  Prior(\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{B(\alpha,\beta)} \varepsilon ^{\alpha - 1} (1 - \varepsilon)^{\beta - 1}
\f]
The posterior probability is therefore again given by a beta distribution:
\f[
  P(\varepsilon |k,N) \propto \varepsilon ^{k + \alpha - 1} (1 - \varepsilon)^{N - k + \beta - 1}
\f]
In case of central intervals
the lower boundary for the equal-tailed confidence interval is given by the
inverse cumulative (= quantile) function for the quantile \f$ \frac{1 - level}{2} \f$.
The upper boundary for the equal-tailed confidence interval is given by the
inverse cumulative (= quantile) function for the quantile \f$ \frac{1 + level}{2} \f$.

Calculates the boundaries for the frequentist Clopper-Pearson interval

This interval is recommended by the PDG.

\param[in] total number of total events
\param[in] passed 0 <= number of passed events <= total
\param[in] level confidence level
\param[in] bUpper true  - upper boundary is returned
                 ;false - lower boundary is returned

Calculation:

The lower boundary of the Clopper-Pearson interval is the "exact" inversion
of the test:
   \f{eqnarray*}{
      P(x \geq passed; total) &=& \frac{1 - level}{2}\\
      P(x \geq passed; total) &=& 1 - P(x \leq passed - 1; total)\\
      &=& 1 - \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{0}^{1 - \varepsilon} t^{total - passed} (1 - t)^{passed - 1} dt\\
      &=& 1 - \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{\varepsilon}^{1} t^{passed - 1} (1 - t)^{total - passed} dt\\
      &=& \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{0}^{\varepsilon} t^{passed - 1} (1 - t)^{total - passed} dt\\
      &=& I_{\varepsilon}(passed,total - passed + 1)
    \f}
The lower boundary is therefore given by the \f$ \frac{1 - level}{2}\f$ quantile
of the beta distribution.

The upper boundary of the Clopper-Pearson interval is the "exact" inversion
of the test:
   \f{eqnarray*}{
      P(x \leq passed; total) &=& \frac{1 - level}{2}\\
      P(x \leq passed; total) &=& \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{0}^{1 - \varepsilon} t^{total - passed - 1} (1 - t)^{passed} dt\\
      &=& \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{\varepsilon}^{1} t^{passed} (1 - t)^{total - passed - 1} dt\\
      &=& 1 - \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{0}^{\varepsilon} t^{passed} (1 - t)^{total - passed - 1} dt\\
      \Rightarrow 1 - \frac{1 - level}{2} &=& \frac{1}{norm} * \int_{0}^{\varepsilon} t^{passed} (1 - t)^{total - passed -1} dt\\
      \frac{1 + level}{2} &=& I_{\varepsilon}(passed + 1,total - passed)
    \f}
The upper boundary is therefore given by the \f$\frac{1 + level}{2}\f$ quantile
of the beta distribution.

Note: The connection between the binomial distribution and the regularized
     incomplete beta function \f$ I_{\varepsilon}(\alpha,\beta)\f$ has been used.

              The weights do not need to be normalized, since they are internally renormalized
              to the number of effective entries.
    \param[in] opt
      -  mode : The mode is returned instead of the mean of the posterior as best value
                When using the mode the shortest interval is also computed instead of the central one
      -  shortest: compute shortest interval (done by default if mode option is set)
      -  central: compute central interval (done by default if mode option is NOT set)

    Calculation:

    The combined posterior distributions is calculated from the Bayes theorem assuming a common prior Beta distribution.
        It is easy to proof that the combined posterior is then:
 \f{eqnarray*}{
      P_{comb}(\epsilon |{w_{i}}; {k_{i}}; {N_{i}}) &=& B(\epsilon, \sum_{i}{ w_{i} k_{i}} + \alpha, \sum_{i}{ w_{i}(n_{i}-k_{i})}+\beta)\\
      w_{i} &=& weight\ for\ each\ sample\ renormalized\ to\ the\ effective\ entries\\
      w^{'}_{i} &=&  w_{i} \frac{ \sum_{i} {w_{i} } } { \sum_{i} {w_{i}^{2} } }
    \f}

    The estimated efficiency is the mode (or the mean) of the obtained posterior distribution

    The boundaries of the confidence interval for a confidence level (1 - a)
    are given by the a/2 and 1-a/2 quantiles of the resulting cumulative
    distribution.

\param[in] total number of total events
\param[in] passed 0 <= number of passed events <= total
\param[in] level  confidence level
\param[in] bUpper
                - true  - upper boundary is returned
                - false - lower boundary is returned

Calculation:

      \alpha &=& 1 - \frac{level}{2}\\
      \kappa &=& \Phi^{-1}(1 - \alpha,1) ...\ normal\ quantile\ function\\
      mode &=& \frac{passed + \frac{\kappa^{2}}{2}}{total + \kappa^{2}}\\
      \Delta &=& \frac{\kappa}{total + \kappa^{2}} * \sqrt{passed (1 - \frac{passed}{total}) + \frac{\kappa^{2}}{4}}\\
      return &=& max(0,mode - \Delta)\ or\ min(1,mode + \Delta)
