## Removal and Deprecation

The following interfaces have been removed:

- The `RooAbsReal::plotSliceOn()` function that was deprecated since at least ROOT 6 was removed. Use `plotOn(frame,Slice(...))` instead.
- Multiple overloads of internal Minuit 2 constructors and functions have been removed. If your code fails to compile, you can easily change to another overload that takes a `MnUserParameterState`, which is a change backwards compatible with older ROOT versions.

The following interfaces are deprecated and will be removed in future releases:

- The `RooTemplateProxy` constructors that take a `proxyOwnsArg` parameter to manually pass ownership are deprecated and replaced by a new constructor that takes ownership via `std::unique_ptr<T>`. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36.
- Several RooFit legacy functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36 (see section "RooFit libraries")
- The `int ROOT::CompressionSettings(ROOT::ECompressionAlgorithm algorithm, int compressionLevel)` function is deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36. Please use `int CompressionSettings(RCompressionSetting::EAlgorithm::EValues algorithm, int compressionLevel)` instead.
- The `void R__zip(int cxlevel, int *srcsize, char *src, int *tgtsize, char *tgt, int *irep)`  is deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36. Please use `void R__zipMultipleAlgorithm(int cxlevel, int *srcsize, char *src, int *tgtsize, char *tgt, int *irep, ROOT::RCompressionSetting::EAlgorithm::EValues algorithm)` instead.
- The `Bool_t TGeoShape::AreOverlapping(const TGeoBBox *box1, const TGeoMatrix *mat1, const TGeoBBox *box2, const TGeoMatrix *mat2)` is deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.
- The `TPython::Eval()` function that is deprecated scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36.


## Core Libraries

* The Cling C++ interpreter now relies on LLVM version 18.
* The `rootcling` invocation corresponding to a `genreflex` invocation can be obtained with the new `genreflex`
  command line argument `--print-rootcling-invocation`. This can be useful when migrating from genreflex to
  rootcling.
* The `rootcling` utility now fully supports selection xml files and not only LinkDef files.

## I/O Libraries

## RNTuple Libraries

* The first version of the `RNTuple` on-disk binary format is finalized. Future versions of ROOT will be able to read back
  RNTuple data written as of this release. Please note that this version breaks compatibility with experimental RNTuple
  data written with releases up to v6.34. Please also note that the RNTuple API is not yet moving out of
  `ROOT::Experimental`.
* Support for low-precision on-disk floating point representation. This can be enabled through
  `RField<float|double>::SetTruncated()` (truncated mantissa) and `RField<float|double>::SetQuantized()`
  (scaled integer representation).
* Link RNTuple self-description to the common ROOT streamer infrastructure. As a result, `TFile::MakeProject()`
  properly creates header files for classes used in RNTuple data.
* First version of the new `RNTupleProcessor` class. The `RNTupleProcessor` will support iteration of composed RNTuple data sets (comparable to and improving upon TTree friends and chains). This release supports chained (vertically composed) RNTuples. Other types of concatenations will be added in subsequent releases.
* Support for cluster staging in the `RNTupleParallelWriter`. Cluster staging enables users to enforce a certain
  logical cluster ordering in the presence of parallel cluster writing.
* Support for Direct I/O for writing. This gives access to the peak performance of modern NVMe drives.
* Support for a "streamer field" that can wrap classic ROOT I/O serialized data for RNTuple in cases where native
  RNTuple support is not possible (e.g., recursive data structures). Use of the streamer field can be enforced
  through the LinkDef option `rntupleStreamerMode(true)`.  This features is similar to the unsplit/level-0-split branch in `TTree`.
* Naming rules have been established for the strings representing the name of an RNTuple and the name of a field. The
  allowed character set is restricted to Unicode characters encoded as UTF-8, with the following exceptions: control
  codes, full stop, space, backslash, slash. See a full description in the RNTuple specification. The naming rules are
  also enforced when creating a new RNTuple or field for writing.
* Many fixes to RNTuple merging, both through `hadd` and when using the `RNTupleMerger` class directly. Most notable
  of these fixes is the proper handling of projected fields.
* Many additional bug fixes and improvements.

## TTree Libraries
* TTreeReader can now detect whether there is a mismatched number of entries between the main trees and the friend tree
  and act accordingly in two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, at least one of the friend trees is shorter than
  the main tree, i.e. it has less entries. When the reader is trying to load an entry from the main tree which is beyond
  the last entry of the shorter friend, this will result in an error and stop execution. In the second scenario, at
  least one friend is longer than the main tree, i.e. it has more entries. Once the reader arrives at the end of the
  main tree, it will issue a warning informing the user that there are still entries to be read from the longer friend.
* TTreeReader can now detect whether a branch, which was previously expected to exist in the dataset, has disappeared
  due to e.g. a branch missing when switching to the next file in a chain of files.
* TTreeReader can now detect whether an entry being read is incomplete due to one of the following scenarios:
  * When switching to a new tree in the chain, a branch that was expected to be found is not available.
  * When doing event matching with TTreeIndex, one or more of the friend trees did not match the index value for
    the current entry.


## RDataFrame

* The `GetColumnNames` function to retrieve the number of available column names in the RDataFrame object is now also
  usable from a node of a distributed computation graph. This makes the generation of said computation graph slightly
  less lazy than before. Notably, it used to be the case that a distributed computation graph could be defined with
  code that was not yet available on the user's local application, but that would only become available in the
  distributed worker. Now a call such as `df.Define("mycol", "return run_my_fun();")` needs to be at least declarable
  to the interpreter also locally so that the column can be properly tracked.
* The order of execution of operations within the same branch of the computation graph is now guaranteed to be top to
  bottom. For example, the following code:
  ~~~{.cpp}
  ROOT::RDataFrame df{1};
  auto df1 = df.Define("x", []{ return 11; });
  auto df2 = df1.Define("y", []{ return 22; });
  auto graph = df2.Graph<int, int>("x","y");
  ~~~
  will first execute the operation `Define` of the column `x`, then the one of the column `y`, when filling the graph.
* The `DefinePerSample` operation now works also in the case when a TTree is stored in a subdirectory of a TFile.
* The memory usage of distributed RDataFrame was drastically reduced by better managing caches of the computation graph
  artifacts. Large applications which previously had issues with killed executors due to being out of memory now show a
  minimal memory footprint. See https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16094#issuecomment-2252273470 for more details.
* RDataFrame can now read TTree branches of type `std::array` on disk explicitly as `std::array` values in memory.
* New parts of the API were added to allow dealing with missing data in a TTree-based dataset:
  * DefaultValueFor(colname, defaultval): lets the user provide one default value for the current entry of the input
    column, in case the value is missing.
  * FilterAvailable(colname): works in the same way as the traditional Filter operation, where the "expression" is "is
    the value available?". If so, the entry is kept, if not, it is discarded.
  * FilterMissing(colname): works in the same way as the traditional Filter operation, where the "expression" is "is
    the value missing?". If so, the entry is kept, if not, it is discarded.
  The tutorials `df036_missingBranches` and `df037_TTreeEventMatching` show example usage of the new functionalities.
* The automatic conversion of `std::vector` to `ROOT::RVec` which happens in memory within a JIT-ted RDataFrame
  computation graph meant that the result of a `Snapshot` operation would implicitly change the type of the input branch.
  A new option available as the data member `fVector2RVec` of the `RSnapshotOptions` struct can be used to prevent
  RDataFrame from making this implicit conversion.
* RDataFrame does not take a lock anymore to check reading of supported types when there is a mismatch, see
  https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16528.
* Complexity of lookups during internal checks for type matching has been made constant on average, see the discussions
  at https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16559 and https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/16559.
* Major improvements have been brought to the experimental feature that allows lazily loading ROOT data into batches for
  machine learning model training pipelines. For a full description, see the presentation at CHEP 2024
  https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338689/contributions/6015940/.

## Histogram Libraries

* `THStack:GetMinimum()` was not correct in case of negative contents.

### Upgrade TUnfold to version 17.9

The [TUnfold package](https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html) inside ROOT is upgraded from version 17.6 to version 17.9.

## Math Libraries

### Minuit2

* **Usage of `std::span<const double>`in the interface**: To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.
This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged.

* **Initial error/covariance matrix values for Hessian matrix**: Initial error/covariance matrix values can be passed for initializating the Hessian matrix to be used in minimization algorithms by attaching the covariance matrix to the `ROOT::Minuit2::MnUserParameterState` instance used for seeding via the method `AddCovariance(const MnUserCovariance &);`.

## RooFit Libraries

### Error handling in MultiProcess-enabled fits

The `MultiProcess`-based fitting stack now handles errors during fits.
Error signaling in (legacy) RooFit happens through two mechanisms: `logEvalError` calls and `RooNaNPacker`-enhanced NaN doubles.
Both are now implemented and working for `MultiProcess`-based fits as well.
See [this PR](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/15797) for more details.
This enables the latest ATLAS Higgs combination fits to complete successfully, and also other fits that encounter NaN values or other expected errors.

### Miscellaneous

* Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name. If you want to do fast lookups by name, convert your RooArgList to a RooArgSet.

* The function `RooFit::bindFunction()` now supports arbitrary many input variables when binding a Python function.

* The `ExportOnly()` attribute of the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object is now switched on by default, and the associated getter and setter functions are deprecated. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36. If you want to fit the model as well instead of just exporting it to a RooWorkspace, please do so with your own code as demonstrated in the `hf001` tutorial.

* Initial error values can be used for initializating the Hessian matrix to be used in Minuit2 minimization algorithms by setting the `RooMinimizer::Config` option `setInitialCovariance` to `true`. These values correspond to the diagonal entries of the initial covariance matrix.

* Fixed a bug where in some circumstances `hadd` would not correctly merge objects in nested folders of a ROOT file.

* `RooFit::MultiProcess`-enabled fitting developer/advanced documentation -- [available through GitHub](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/roofit/doc/developers/test_statistics.md) -- was updated. It now contains the most up to date usage instructions for optimizing load balancing (and hence run speed) using this backend.

### Deprecations

* The `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataSet` and `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataHist` functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36. The same functionality can be implemented by calling `RooAbsData::reduce` on the Markov Chain's `RooDataSet*` (obtained using `MarkovChain::GetAsConstDataSet`) and then obtaining its binned clone(for `RooDataHist`).

  An example in Python would be:

  ```py
  mcInt = mc.GetInterval() # Obtain the MCMCInterval from a configured MCMCCalculator
  mkc = mcInt.GetChain() # Obtain the MarkovChain
  mkcData = mkc.GetAsConstDataSet()
  mcIntParams = mcInt.GetParameters()

  chainDataset = mkcData.reduce(SelectVars=mcIntParams, EventRange=(mcInt.GetNumBurnInSteps(), mkc.Size()))
  chainDataHist = chainDataset.binnedClone()
  ```

* The following methods related to the RooAbsArg interface are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.
They should be replaced with the suitable alternatives interfaces:

    - `RooAbsArg::getDependents()`: use `getObservables()`
    - `RooAbsArg::dependentOverlaps()`: use `observableOverlaps()`
    - `RooAbsArg::checkDependents()`: use `checkObservables()`
    - `RooAbsArg::recursiveCheckDependents()`: use `recursiveCheckObservables()`

## TMVA SOFIE
The support for new ONNX operators has been included in the SOFIE ONNX parser and in RModel in order to generate inference code for new types of models.
The full list of currently supported operators is available [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/tmva/sofie/README.md#supported-onnx-operators)

The list of operators added for this release is the following:
   - Constant and ConstantOfShape
   - If
   - Range
   - ReduceSum
   - Split
   - Tile
   - TopK

In addition support in RModel has been added to generate the code with dynamic input shape parameter, such as the batch size. These input shape parameters can be specified at run time when evaluating the model.
Since not all ONNX operators in SOFIE support yet dynamic input parameters, it is possible to initialize a parsed dynamic model with fixed values. For this, a new member function, `RModel::Initialize(const std::map<std::string,size_t> & inputParams, bool verbose = false)` has been added.
The RModel class has been extended to support sub-graph (needed for operator `If`), dynamic tensors and constant tensors (for example those defined by the operator `Constant`).

## Graphics Backends

### Web-based TWebCanvas

Support "haxis" draw option for histograms, allows superposition of several histograms drawn on the same pad with horizontal ty axis. Add `tutorials\webcanv\haxis.cxx` macro demonstrating new feature.

Support "frame" draw option for several primitives like `TBox`, `TLine`, `TLatex`. This enforce clipping of such objects by
frame border. Provide demo in `tutorials\webcanv\inframe.cxx` macro

Provide batch mode for image production with headless browser. In such mode data for several canvases collected together (in batch) and then N images are produced with single invocation of the web browser (chrome or firefox). For instance after `TWebCanvas::BatchImageMode(100)` next 99 calls to `TCanvas::SaveAs(filename)` method will not lead to image files creation. But with following call all 100 images will be produced together. Alternatively one can use `TCanvas::SaveAll()` static method which allows to create images for several canvases at once.

Support multi-page PDF file creation with web-based canvas using `svg2pdf.js` library. Both with native and web-baed graphics one can do now:
```c++
c1->SaveAs("file.pdf[")
c2->SaveAs("file.pdf+")
c3->SaveAs("file.pdf+")
c4->SaveAs("file.pdf]")
```
Or same can be achieved with:
```c++
TCanvas::SaveAll({c1, c2, c3, c4}, "file.pdf");
```

## 2D Graphics Libraries
* In `TGraphErrors` `TGraphAsymmErrors` and `TGraphBentErrors`, the error bars were drawn inside the marker when the marker was bigger than the error bars. This produced a weird plot. This is now fixed.

* When error-bars exceeded the y range limits the end of error bars were nevertheless displayed was not correcton the x-bottom and top axis. So it looked like the total error bar while it was indeed not.

* Choosing an appropriate color scheme is essential for making results easy to understand and interpret. Factors like colorblindness and converting colors to grayscale for publications can impact accessibility. Furthermore, results should be aesthetically pleasing. The following three color schemes, recommended by M. Petroff in [arXiv:2107.02270v2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02270) and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mpetroff/accessible-color-cycles) under the MIT License, meet these criteria.

* Implement properly the TScatter palette attributes as requested [here](https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/15922).

* Add `TStyle::SetLegendFillStyle`

## 3D Graphics Libraries

## Geometry Libraries

The geometry package is now optional and activated by default in the CMake configuration. To disable it, use the `-Dgeometry=OFF` CMake option.

## Web-based GUIs

Adjust `rootssh` script to be usable on MacOS. Fixing problem to start more than one web widget on remote node.

Fix `rootbrowse` script to be able properly use it with all kinds of web widgets. Provide `--web=<type>` argument as for
regular root executable.

Update openui5 library to version 1.128.0. Requires use of modern web-browsers, skipping IE support.

## Python Interface

### Typesafe `TTree::SetBranchAddress()` for array inputs

If you call `TTree::SetBranchAddress` with NumPy array or `array.array` inputs, ROOT will now check if the array type matches with the column type.
If it doesn't, `SetBranchAddress()` will return a negative status code and print an error.
Take for example this code snippet:
```python
arr = array.array(typecode, "d")
status = t.SetBranchAddress("name", arr)
print("Status = %s" % (status, ))
```
If the branch type is also `double` (like the type of the array indicated by `"d"`), the call to `SetBranchAddress()` would succeed with status code zero.
If the type doesn't match, you now get a clear error instead of garbage values.
```txt
Error in <TTree::SetBranchAddress>: The pointer type given "Double_t" (8) does not correspond to the type needed "Float_t" (5) by the branch: a
Status = -2
```

### Deprecation of `TPython::Eval()`

The `TPython::Eval()` method is deprecated and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36.
Its implementation was fragile, and the same functionality can be achieved with `TPython::Exec()`, using a C++ variable that is known to the ROOT interpreter for crossing over from Python to C++.

Example:
```c++
// Before, with TPython::Eval()
std::string stringVal = static_cast<const char*>(TPython::Eval("'done'"));
std::cout << stringVal << std::endl;

// Now, with TPython::Exec(). You can set `_anyresult` to whatever std::any you want.
// It will be swapped into the return variable in the end.

std::any result;
TPython::Exec("_anyresult = ROOT.std.make_any['std::string']('done')", &result);
std::cout << std::any_cast<std::string>(result) << std::endl;
```
