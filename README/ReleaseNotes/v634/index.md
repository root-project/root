## Deprecation and Removal

- The `RooAbsReal::plotSliceOn()` function that was deprecated since at least ROOT 6 was removed. Use `plotOn(frame,Slice(...))` instead.
- The `RooTemplateProxy` constructors that take a `proxyOwnsArg` parameter to manually pass ownership are deprecated and replaced by a new constructor that takes ownership via `std::unique_ptr<T>`. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36.
- Several RooFit legacy functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36 (see section "RooFit libraries")
- Multiple overloads of internal Minuit 2 constructors and functions have been removed. If your code fails to compile, you can easily change to another overload that takes a `MnUserParameterState`, which is a change backwards compatible with older ROOT versions.

## Core Libraries

* The `rootcling` invocation corresponding to a `genreflex` invocation can be obtained with the new `genreflex`
  command line argument `--print-rootcling-invocation`. This can be useful when migrating from genreflex to
  rootcling.
* The `rootcling` utility now fully supports selection xml files and not only LinkDef files.

## I/O Libraries


## TTree Libraries

## RDataFrame

* The `GetColumnNames` function to retrieve the number of available column names in the RDataFrame object is now also
  usable from a node of a distributed computation graph. This makes the generation of said computation graph slightly
  less lazy than before. Notably, it used to be the case that a distributed computation graph could be defined with
  code that was not yet available on the user's local application, but that would only become available in the
  distributed worker. Now a call such as `df.Define("mycol", "return run_my_fun();")` needs to be at least declarable
  to the interpreter also locally so that the column can be properly tracked.

## Histogram Libraries

### Upgrade TUnfold to version 17.9

The [TUnfold package](https://www.desy.de/~sschmitt/tunfold.html) inside ROOT is upgraded from version 17.6 to version 17.9.

## Math Libraries

### Usage of `std::span<const double>` in Minuit 2 interfaces

To avoid forcing the user to do manual memory allocations via `std::vector`, the interfaces of Minuit 2 function adapter classes like `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase` or `ROOT::Minuit2::FCNGradientBase` were changed to accept `std::span<const double>` arguments instead of `std::vector<double> const&`.
This should have minimal impact on users, since one should usual use Minuit 2 via the `ROOT::Math::Minimizer` interface, which is unchanged.

## RooFit Libraries

### Miscellaneous

* Setting `useHashMapForFind(true)` is not supported for RooArgLists anymore, since hash-assisted finding by name hash can be ambiguous: a RooArgList is allowed to have different elements with the same name. If you want to do fast lookups by name, convert your RooArgList to a RooArgSet.

* The function `RooFit::bindFunction()` now supports arbitrary many input variables when binding a Python function.

* The `ExportOnly()` attribute of the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object is now switched on by default, and the associated getter and setter functions are deprecated. They will be removed in ROOT 6.36. If you want to fit the model as well instead of just exporting it to a RooWorkspace, please do so with your own code as demonstrated in the `hf001` tutorial.

### Deprecations

* The `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataSet` and `RooStats::MarkovChain::GetAsDataHist` functions are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36. The same functionality can be implemented by calling `RooAbsData::reduce` on the Markov Chain's `RooDataSet*` (obtained using `MarkovChain::GetAsConstDataSet`) and then obtaining its binned clone(for `RooDataHist`).

  An example in Python would be:

  ```py
  mcInt = mc.GetInterval() # Obtain the MCMCInterval from a configured MCMCCalculator
  mkc = mcInt.GetChain() # Obtain the MarkovChain
  mkcData = mkc.GetAsConstDataSet()
  mcIntParams = mcInt.GetParameters()

  chainDataset = mkcData.reduce(SelectVars=mcIntParams, EventRange=(mcInt.GetNumBurnInSteps(), mkc.Size()))
  chainDataHist = chainDataset.binnedClone()
  ```

* The following methods related to the RooAbsArg interface are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.36.
They should be replaced with the suitable alternatives interfaces:

    - `RooAbsArg::getDependents()`: use `getObservables()`
    - `RooAbsArg::dependentOverlaps()`: use `observableOverlaps()`
    - `RooAbsArg::checkDependents()`: use `checkObservables()`
    - `RooAbsArg::recursiveCheckDependents()`: use `recursiveCheckObservables()`

### Typesafe `TTree::SetBranchAddress()` for array inputs

If you call `TTree::SetBranchAddress` with NumPy array or `array.array` inputs, ROOT will now check if the array type matches with the column type.
If it doesn't, `SetBranchAddress()` will return a negative status code and print an error.
Take for example this code snippet:
```python
arr = array.array(typecode, "d")
status = t.SetBranchAddress("name", arr)
print("Status = %s" % (status, ))
```
If the branch type is also `double` (like the type of the array indicated by `"d"`), the call to `SetBranchAddress()` would succeed with status code zero.
If the type doesn't match, you now get a clear error instead of garbage values.
```txt
Error in <TTree::SetBranchAddress>: The pointer type given "Double_t" (8) does not correspond to the type needed "Float_t" (5) by the branch: a
Status = -2
```

### Deprecation of `TPython::Eval()`

The `TPython::Eval()` method is deprecated and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36.
Its implementation was fragile, and the same functionality can be achieved with `TPython::Exec()`, using a C++ variable that is known to the ROOT interpreter for crossing over from Python to C++.

Example:
```c++
// Before, with TPython::Eval()
std::string stringVal = static_cast<const char*>(TPython::Eval("'done'"));
std::cout << stringVal << std::endl;

// Now, with TPython::Exec(). You can set `_anyresult` to whatever std::any you want.
// It will be swapped into the return variable in the end.

std::any result;
TPython::Exec("_anyresult = ROOT.std.make_any['std::string']('done')", &result);
std::cout << std::any_cast<std::string>(result) << std::endl;
```
