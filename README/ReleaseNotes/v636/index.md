## Deprecation and Removal

* The RooFit legacy interfaces that were deprecated in ROOT 6.34 and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36 are removed. See the RooFit section in the 6.34 release notes for a full list.
* The `TPython::Eval()` function that was deprecated in ROOT 6.34 and scheduled for removal in ROOT 6.36 is removed.
* The `RooDataSet` constructors to construct a dataset from a part of an existing dataset are deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.38. This is to avoid interface duplication. Please use `RooAbsData::reduce()` instead, or if you need to change the weight column, use the universal constructor with the `Import()`, `Cut()`, and `WeightVar()` arguments.
* The ROOT splash screen was removed for Linux and macOS
* Proof support has been completely removed form RooFit and RooStats, after it was already not working anymore for several releases

## Python Interface

## RDataFrame

## RooFit

### Breaking function signature changes

  * The `RooRealVar::format()` function was changed to return a `std::string` instead of a `TString *`.
    The former return type was not memory safe, since the caller had to delete the `TString`.
    This pattern was not appropriate for a modern C++ library.
    If you absolutely need the old return type, wrap the call to `format()` inside `new TString{var.format(..)}`. However, this is not recommended.
