## Deprecation and Removal

- The "Virtual MonteCarlo" facility VMC (`montecarlo/vmc`) has been removed from ROOT. The development of this package has moved to a [separate project](https://github.com/vmc-project/). ROOT's copy of VMC was deprecated since v6.18.

- `TTreeProcessorMT::SetMaxTasksPerFilePerWorker` has been removed. `TTreeProcessorMT::SetTasksPerWorkerHint` is a superior alternative.


## Core Libraries


## I/O Libraries


## TTree Libraries

## RDataFrame

### New features and improvements

- Add `Redefine` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to overwrite the value of an existing column.
- Add `Describe` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to get useful information, e.g. the columns and their types.
- Add `DescribeDataset` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to get information about the dataset (subset of the output of Describe()).
- `Book` now suports just-in-time compilation, i.e. it can be called without passing the column types as template parameters (with some performance penalty, as usual).
- Scaling behavior at high core counts (32+ cores) has been improved (see also [PR #8007](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8007)).

## Histogram Libraries


## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries
### Creating RooFit datasets from RDataFrame
RooFit now contains two RDataFrame action helpers, `RooDataSetHelper` and `RooDataHistHelper`, which allow for creating RooFit datasets by booking an action:
```c++
  RooRealVar x("x", "x", -5.,   5.);
  RooRealVar y("y", "y", -50., 50.);
  auto myDataSet = rdataframe.Book<double, double>(
    RooDataSetHelper{"dataset",          // Name   (directly forwarded to RooDataSet::RooDataSet())
                    "Title of dataset",  // Title  (                   ~ " ~                      )
                    RooArgSet(x, y) },   // Variables to create in dataset
    {"x", "y"}                           // Column names from RDataFrame
  );
```
For more details, consult the tutorial [rf408_RDataFrameToRooFit](https://root.cern/doc/v626/rf408__RDataFrameToRooFit_8C.html).

### Changes in `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` behaviour for multi-range fits

The `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` functions accept a command argument to specify the fit range.
One can also fit in multiple ranges simultaneously.
The definition of such multi-range likelihoods for non-extended fits changes in this release.
Previously, the individual likelihoods were normalized separately in each range, which meant that the relative number of events in each sub-range was not used to estimate the PDF parameters.
From now on, the likelihoods are normalized by the sum of integrals in each range. This implies that the likelihood takes into account all inter-range and intra-range information.
