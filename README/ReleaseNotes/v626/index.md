## Deprecation, Removal, Backward Incompatibilities

- The "Virtual MonteCarlo" facility VMC (`montecarlo/vmc`) has been removed from ROOT. The development of this package has moved to a [separate project](https://github.com/vmc-project/). ROOT's copy of VMC was deprecated since v6.18.
- `TTreeProcessorMT::SetMaxTasksPerFilePerWorker` has been removed. `TTreeProcessorMT::SetTasksPerWorkerHint` is a superior alternative.
- `TTree::GetEntry()` and `TTree::GetEvent()` no longer have 0 as the default value for the first parameter `entry`. We are not aware of correct uses of this function without providing an entry number. If you have one, please simply pass `0` from now on.
- `TBufferMerger` is now out of the `Experimental` namespace (`ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMerger` is deprecated, please use `ROOT::TBufferMerger` instead)


## Core Libraries

### Interpreter

- As of v6.26, cling diagnostic messages can be redirected to the ROOT error handler. Users may enable/disable this via `TCling::ReportDiagnosticsToErrorHandler()`, e.g.
```cpp
root [1] gInterpreter->ReportDiagnosticsToErrorHandler();
root [2] int f() { return; }
Error in <cling>: ROOT_prompt_2:1:11: non-void function 'f' should return a value [-Wreturn-type]
int f() { return; }
          ^
```
More details at [PR #8737](https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/8737).

## I/O Libraries


## TTree Libraries

- `TTreeReader::GetEntryStatus` now always reports `kEntryBeyondEnd` after an event loop correctly completes. In previous versions, it could sometime return `kEntryNotFound` even for well-behaved event loops.

## RDataFrame

### New features

- Add `Redefine` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to overwrite the value of an existing column.
- Add `Describe` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to get useful information, e.g. the columns and their types.
- Add `DescribeDataset` to the `RDataFrame` interface, which allows to get information about the dataset (subset of the output of Describe()).
- Add [DefinePerSample](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html#a29d77593e95c0f84e359a802e6836a0e), a method which makes it possible to define columns based on the sample and entry range being processed. It is also a useful way to register callbacks that should only be called when the input dataset/TTree changes.
- `Book` now suports just-in-time compilation, i.e. it can be called without passing the column types as template parameters (with some performance penalty, as usual).
- As an aid to `RDataSource` implementations with which collection sizes can be retrieved more efficiently than the full collection, `#var` can now be used as a short-hand notation for column name `R_rdf_sizeof_var`

### Other improvements

- The scaling to a large amount of threads of computation graphs with many simple `Filter`s or `Define`s has been greatly improved, see also [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1036730/#1-a-performance-study-of-the-r) for more details

## Histogram Libraries

- Implement the `SetStats` method for `TGraph` to turn ON or OFF the statistics box display
  for an individual `TGraph`.

## Math Libraries

- I/O support of `RVec` objects has been optimized. As a side-effect, `RVec`s can now be read back as `std::vector`s and vice-versa.


## RooFit Libraries
### Creating RooFit datasets from RDataFrame
RooFit now contains two RDataFrame action helpers, `RooDataSetHelper` and `RooDataHistHelper`, which allow for creating RooFit datasets by booking an action:
```c++
  RooRealVar x("x", "x", -5.,   5.);
  RooRealVar y("y", "y", -50., 50.);
  auto myDataSet = rdataframe.Book<double, double>(
    RooDataSetHelper{"dataset",          // Name   (directly forwarded to RooDataSet::RooDataSet())
                    "Title of dataset",  // Title  (                   ~ " ~                      )
                    RooArgSet(x, y) },   // Variables to create in dataset
    {"x", "y"}                           // Column names from RDataFrame
  );
```
For more details, consult the tutorial [rf408_RDataFrameToRooFit](https://root.cern/doc/v626/rf408__RDataFrameToRooFit_8C.html).

### Storing global observables in RooFit datasets

RooFit groups model variables into *observables* and *parameters*, depending on if their values are stored in the dataset.
For fits with parameter constraints, there is a third kind of variables, called *global observables*.
These represent the results of auxiliary measurements that constrain the nuisance parameters.
In the RooFit implementation, a likelihood is generally the sum of two terms:
  * the likelihood of the data given the parameters, where the normalization set is the set of observables (implemented by `RooNLLVar`)
  * the constraint term, where the normalization set is the set of *global observables* (implemented by `RooConstraintSum`)

Before this release, the global observable values were always taken from the model/pdf.
With this release, a mechanism is added to store a snapshot of global observables in any `RooDataSet` or `RooDataHist`.
For toy studies where the global observables assume a different values for each toy, the bookkeeping of the set of global observables and in particular their values is much easier with this change.

Usage example for a model with global observables `g1` and `g2`:
```C++
auto data = model.generate(x, 1000); // data has only the single observables x
data->setGlobalObservables(g1, g2); // now, data also stores a snapshot of g1 and g2

// If you fit the model to the data, the global observables and their values
// are taken from the dataset:
model.fitTo(*data);

// You can still define the set of global observables yourself, but the values
// will be takes from the dataset if available:
model.fitTo(*data, GlobalObservables(g1, g2));

// To force `fitTo` to take the global observable values from the model even
// though they are in the dataset, you can use the new `GlobalObservablesSource`
// command argument:
model.fitTo(*data, GlobalObservables(g1, g2), GlobalObservablesSource("model"));
// The only other allowed value for `GlobalObservablesSource` is "data", which
// corresponds to the new default behavior explained above.
```

In case you create a RooFit dataset directly by calling its constructor, you can also pass the global observables in a command argument instead of calling `setGlobalObservables()` later:
```C++
RooDataSet data{"dataset", "dataset", x, RooFit::GlobalObservables(g1, g2)};
```

To access the set of global observables stored in a `RooAbsData`, call `RooAbsData::getGlobalObservables()`.
It returns a `nullptr` if no global observable snapshots are stored in the dataset.

### Changes in `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` behaviour for multi-range fits

The `RooAbsPdf::fitTo` and `RooAbsPdf::createNLL` functions accept a command argument to specify the fit range.
One can also fit in multiple ranges simultaneously.
The definition of such multi-range likelihoods for non-extended fits changes in this release.
Previously, the individual likelihoods were normalized separately in each range, which meant that the relative number of events in each sub-range was not used to estimate the PDF parameters.
From now on, the likelihoods are normalized by the sum of integrals in each range. This implies that the likelihood takes into account all inter-range and intra-range information.

### Deprecation of the `RooMinuit` class

The `RooMinuit` class was the old interface between RooFit and minuit. With ROOT version 5.24, a the more general `RooMinimizer` adapter was introduced, which became the default with ROOT 6.08.

Before 6.26, it was possible to still use the `RooMinuit` by passing the `Minimizer("OldMinuit", "minimizer")` command argument to `RooAbsPdf::fitTo()`. This option is now removed.

### Increase of the `RooAbsArg` class version

The class version of `RooAbsArg` was incremented from 7 to 8 in this release. In some circumstances, this can cause warnings in `TStreamerInfo` for classes inheriting from `RooAbsArg` when reading older RooFit models from a file. These warnings are harmless and can be avoided by incrementing also the class version of the inheriting class.

## 2D Graphics Libraries

- Implement the option `X+` and `Y+` for reverse axis on TGraph.
- Offsets for axis titles with absolute-sized fonts (size%10 == 3) are now relative only to the font size (i.e. no longer relative to pad dimensions).
- In `TPaletteAxis` when the palette width is bigger than the palette height, the palette
  in automatically drawn horizontally.
