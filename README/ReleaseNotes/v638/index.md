## Deprecation and Removal

* The `RooDataSet` constructors to construct a dataset from a part of an existing dataset were deprecated in ROOT 6.36 and are now removed. This is to avoid interface duplication. Please use `RooAbsData::reduce()` instead, or if you need to change the weight column, use the universal constructor with the `Import()`, `Cut()`, and `WeightVar()` arguments.
* The `RooStats::HLFactory` class that was deprecated in ROOT 6.36 is now removed. It provided little advantage over using the RooWorkspace directly or any of the other higher-level frameworks that exist in the RooFit ecosystem.
