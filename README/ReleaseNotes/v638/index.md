## Deprecation and Removal

* The `RooDataSet` constructors to construct a dataset from a part of an existing dataset were deprecated in ROOT 6.36 and are now removed. This is to avoid interface duplication. Please use `RooAbsData::reduce()` instead, or if you need to change the weight column, use the universal constructor with the `Import()`, `Cut()`, and `WeightVar()` arguments.
* The `RooStats::HLFactory` class that was deprecated in ROOT 6.36 is now removed. It provided little advantage over using the RooWorkspace directly or any of the other higher-level frameworks that exist in the RooFit ecosystem.

### Error out when setting out-of-range variable value instead of silent clipping

In previous versions, if you set the value of a variable with `RooRealVar::setVal()`, the value was silently clippend when it was outside the variable range.
This silent mutation of data can be dangerous.
With ROOT 6.38, an exception will be thrown instead.
If you know what you are doing and want to restore the old clipping behavior, you can do so with `RooRealVar::enableSilentClipping()`, but this is not recommended.

## Versions of built-in packages

* The version of openssl has been updated to 3.5.0
