## Deprecation and Removal

- The deprecated types `ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMerger` and `ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMergerFile` are removed.
Please use their non-experimental counterparts `ROOT::TBufferMerger` and `ROOT::TBufferMergerFile` instead.
- `ROOT::RVec::shrink_to_fit()` has now been removed after deprecation; it is not needed.
- `ROOT::RVec::emplace()` has now been removed after deprecation; please use `ROOT::RVec::insert()` instead.
- The deprecated function `ROOT::Detail::RDF::RActionImpl<Helper>::GetDataBlockCallback()` is removed; please use `GetSampleCallback()` instead.
- The deprecated RooFit containers `RooHashTable`, `RooNameSet`, `RooSetPair`, and `RooList` are removed. Please use STL container classes instead, like `std::unordered_map`, `std::set`, and `std::vector`.
- The `RooFit::FitOptions(const char*)` command to steer [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooAbsPdf.html) with an option string was removed. This way of configuring the fit was deprecated since at least since ROOT 5.02.
  Subsequently, the `RooMinimizer::fit(const char*)` function and the [RooMCStudy](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooMCStudy.html) constructor that takes an option string were removed as well.
- The overload of `RooAbsData::createHistogram` that takes integer parameters for the bin numbers is now deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.30.
  This was done to avoid confusion with inconsistent behavior when compared to other `createHistogram` overloads.
  Please use the verson of `createHistogram` that takes RooFit command arguments.
- The `RooAbsData::valid()` method to cache valid entries in the variable range
  was removed. It was not implemented in RooDataSet, so it never worked as
  intended. Related to it was the `RooDataHist::cacheValidEntries()` function, which is removed as well.
  The preferred way to reduce RooFit datasets to subranges is [RooAbsData::reduce()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooAbsData.html#acfa7b31e5cd751eec1bc4e95d2796390).
- The longtime-deprecated `RooStats::HistFactory::EstimateSummary` class is removed, including the functions that use it. The information that it was meant to store is managed by the `RooStats::HistFactory::Measurement` object since many years.
- The `RooSuperCategory::MakeIterator()` function that was deprecated since 6.22 is now removed. Please use range-based loops to iterate over the category states.
- The `HybridCalculatorOriginal` and `HypoTestInverterOriginal` classes in RooStats that were deprecated for a very long time aleady are removed. Please use `HybridCalculator` and `HypoTestInverter`.
- The `RooSimPdfBuilder` that was deprecated in ROOT 5.20 and replaced by the `RooSimWSTool` is removed.


## rootreadspeed

This version adds the new `rootreadspeed` CLI tool. This tool can be used to help identify bottlenecks in analysis runtimes, by providing time and throughput measurements when reading ROOT files via file systems or XRootD. More detailed information can be found in the tool's help information.

To see help information, install and source a recent enough version of ROOT, and run the command `rootreadspeed --help` in your terminal.

### Example usage of the tool:

```console
$ rootreadspeed --files <local-folder>/File1.root xrootd://<url-folder>/File2.root --trees Events --all-branches --threads 8
```

## Core Libraries

### Support for profiling/debugging interpreted/JITted code

This version of ROOT adds an LLVM JIT event listener to create perf map files
during runtime. This allows profiling of interpreted/JITted code generated by
cling. Instead of function addresses, the perf data will contain full function
names. In addition, stack frame pointers are enabled in JITted code, so full
stack traces can be generated. Debugging is aided by switching off optimisations
and adding frame pointers for better stack traces. However, since both have a
runtime cost, they are disabled by default. Similar to `LD_DEBUG` and `LD_PROFILE`
for `ld.so`, the environment variables `CLING_DEBUG=1` and/or `CLING_PROFILE=1`
can be set to enable debugging and/or profiling.

## I/O Libraries

### Faster reading from EOS

A new cross-protocol redirection has been added to allow files on EOS mounts to be opened
by `TFile::Open` via XRootD protocol rather than via FUSE when that is possible. The
redirection uses the `eos.url.xroot` extended file attribute that is present on files in EOS.
The attribute can be viewed with `getfattr -n eos.url.xroot [file]` on the command line.
When the URL passed into `TFile::Open` is a for a file on an EOS mount, the extended
attribute is used to attempt the redirection to XRootD protocol. If the redirection fails,
the file is opened using the plain file path as before. This feature is controlled by the
pre-existing configuration option `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` and is enabled by default.
It can be disabled by setting `TFile.CrossProtocolRedirects` to `0` in `rootrc`.

## TTree Libraries

## RDataFrame

### New features

- Add [`GraphAsymmErrors`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html#acea30792eef607489d498bf6547a00a6) action that fills a TGraphAsymmErrors object.

### Notable bug fixes and improvements

- Fix the node counter of [`SaveGraph`](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceROOT_1_1RDF.html#ac06a36e745255fb8744b1e0a563074c9), where previously `cling` was getting wrong static initialization.
- Fix [`Graph`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html#a1ca9a94bece4767cac82968910afa02e) action (that fills a TGraph object) to properly handle containers and non-container types.
- The [`RCsvDS`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RCsvDS.html) class now allows users to specify column types, and can properly read empty entries of csv files.

## Histogram Libraries

- New class `TGraph2DAsymmErrors` to create TGraph2D with asymmetric errors.

## Math Libraries


## RooFit Libraries

### Consistent definition of the default minimizer type for all of RooFit/RooStats

In previous releases, the default minimizer type that RooFit used was hardcoded to be the original `Minuit`, while RooStats used the default minimizer specified by `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::DefaultMinimizerType()`. Now it is possible to centrally define the global minimizer for all RooFit libraries via `ROOT::Math::MinimizerOptions::SetDefaultMinimizer()`, or alternatively in the `.rootrc` file by adding for example `Root.Fitter: Minuit2` to select Minuit2.


### Code modernization by using `std::string` in RooFit interfaces

The following lesser-used RooFit functions now return a `std::string` instead of a `const char*`, potentially requiring the update of your code:

- [std::string RooCmdConfig::missingArgs() const](https://root.cern/doc/v628/classRooCmdConfig.html#aec50335293c45a507d347c604bf9651f)
### Uniquely identifying RooArgSet and RooDataSet objects

Before v6.28, it was ensured that no `RooArgSet` and `RooDataSet` objects on the heap were located at an address that had already been used for an instance of the same class before.
With v6.28, this is not guaranteed anymore.
Hence, if your code uses pointer comparisons to uniquely identify RooArgSet or RooDataSet instances, please consider using the new `RooArgSet::uniqueId()` or `RooAbsData::uniqueId()`.

### Introducing binned likelihood fit optimization in HistFactory

In a binned likelihood fit, it is possible to skip the PDF normalization when
the unnormalized binned PDF can be interpreted directly in terms of event
yields. This is now done by default for HistFactory models, which
results in great speedups for binned fits with many channels. Some RooFit users
like ATLAS were already using this for a long time.

To disable this optimization when using the `hist2workspace` executable, add the `-disable_binned_fit_optimization` command line argument.
Directly in C++, you can also set the `binnedFitOptimization` to `false` in the
HistFactory configuration as follows:
```C++
RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, {.binnedFitOptimization=false});
```
If your compiler doesn't support aggregate initialization with designators, you
need to create and edit the configuration struct explicitely:
```C++
RooStats::HistFactory::HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast::Configuration hfCfg;
hfCfg.binnedFitOptimization = false;
RooStats::HistFactory::MakeModelAndMeasurementFast(measurement, hfCfg);
```

### Disable copy assignment for RooAbsArg and derived types

Copy assignment for RooAbsArgs was implemented in an unexpected and
inconsistent way. While one would expect that the copy assignment is copying
the object, it said in the documentation of `RooAbsArg::operator=` that it will
"assign all boolean and string properties of the original bject. Transient
properties and client-server links are not assigned." This contradicted with
the implementation, where the server links were actually copied too.
Furthermore, in `RooAbsRealLValue`, the assigment operator was overloaded by a
function that only assigns the value of another `RooAbsReal`.

With all these inconsistencies, it was deemed safer to disable copy assignment
of RooAbsArgs from now on.

### RooBrowser: a graphical user interface for workspace exploration, visualization, and analysis

This experimental new feature utilises the technology from ROOT's familiar `TBrowser` in order to create an interface for graphically exploring and visualizing the content of a workspace, as well as perform basic fitting operations with the models and datasets.

![Demonstration of RooBrowser using json workspace from the roofit tutorials directory](RooBrowser.png)

To get started with the RooBrowser, open any ROOT file containing a workspace and then create an instance of the `ROOT::Experimental::RooBrowser` just like creating an instance of a `TBrowser`. A window will be displayed with a navigable tree structure on the left that lets you explore the content of the workspaces present in the loaded file. Note that additional files, **including json workspace files**, can be loaded through the `Browser --> Open` menu in the top left corner.

The context menu for each node in the tree structure can be used to get more information about the node. In particular, the `Draw` command can be selected on many of the nodes that are part of a statistical model, which will visualize that part of the model in the browser window. A number of options are available for the `Draw` command, including (some options can be combined):
   * "e" : calculate and visualize propagated model uncertainty
   * "auxratio" : Draw a ratio auxiliary plot below the main plot
   * "auxsignif" : Draw a significance auxiliary plot below the main plot
   * "pull" : show panel of current parameter values, which can be dragged in order to change the values and visualize the effect on the model (very experimental feature).

 Once a node has been drawn, the styling of subsequent draws can be controlled through `TStyle` objects that will now appear in the `objects` folder in the workspace.

A model can be fit to a dataset from the workspace using the `fitTo` context menu command and specifying the name of a dataset in the workspace (if no name is given, an expected dataset corresponding to the current state of the model will be used). A dialog will display the fit result status code when the fit completes and then a `fits` folder will be found under the workspace (the workspace may need to be collapsed and re-expanded to make it appear) where the fit result can be found, selected, and visualized. 

Many more features are available in the `RooBrowser`, and further documentation and development can be found at the [xRooFit](https://gitlab.cern.ch/will/xroofit) repository, which is the library where the browser has been originally developed. The author (Will Buttinger) is also very happy to be contacted with questions or feedback about this new functionality.


### Removal of deprecated HistFactory functionality

#### Removal of HistoToWorkspaceFactory (non-Fast version)

The original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` produced models that consisted of a
Poisson term for each bin.  In this "number counting form" the dataset has one
row and the collumns corresponded to the number of events for each bin. This
led to severe performance problems in statistical tools that generated
pseudo-experiments and evaluated likelihood ratio test statistics.

Nowadays, everyone uses the faster `HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast` implementation that
produces a model in the "standard form" where the dataset has one row for each
event, and the column corresponds to the value of the observable in the
histogram.

Therefore, the original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` is now removed to avoid
confusion and maintainance burden.

#### Removing constant parameter flag from RooStats:HistFactory::NormFactor

As printed out by the HistFactory in a warning message for a long time already,
setting the `Const` attribute to the `<NormFactor>` tag is deprecated and it
will be ignored. Instead, add `<ParamSetting Const="True"> myparam </ParamSetting>` to your top-level XML's `<Measurement>` entry.

This deprecation implied that the constant parameter flag in the
`RooStats:HistFactory::NormFactor` class had no effect as well. To avoid
ambiguity in the future, the possibility to set and retrieve this flag with
`NormFactor::SetConst()` and `NormFactor::GetConst()` was removed, as well as the
`Sample::AddNormFactor(std::string Name, double Val, double Low, double High, bool Const)`
overload. Also, the aforementioned deprecation warning is not printed anymore.

### Removal of `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` and `RooMinimizerFcn` from the public interface

The `RooAbsMinimizerFcn` class and its implementation `RooMinimizerFcn` were removed from the public interface.
These classes are implementation details of the RooMinimizer and should not be used in your code.
In the unlikely case that this causes any problem for you, please open a GitHub issue requesting to extend the RooMinimizer by the needed functionality.

### Vectorize `RooAbsBinning` interface for bin index lookups

The `RooAbsBinning` interface for bin index lookups was changed to enable vectorized implementations.
Instead of having the override `RooAbsBinning::binNumber()`, the binning implementations now have to override the `RooAbsBinning::binNumbers()` function to evaluate the bin indices of multiple values in one function call.

## 2D Graphics Libraries

- Implement the option "File": The current file name is painted on the bottom right of each plot
  if the option `File` is set on via `gStyle->SetOptFile()`.

- In matplolib one can use the "Default X-Points" feature to plot X/Y graphs: If one doesn't
  specify the points in the x-axis, they will get the default values 0, 1, 2, 3, (etc. depending
  on the length of the y-points). The matplotlib script will be:
```
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   points = np.array([3, 8, 1, 10, 5, 7])
   plt.plot(ypoints)
   plt. show()
```
It is now possible to do the same with the ROOT TGraph:
```
   double y[6] = {3, 8, 1, 10, 5, 7};
   auto g = new TGraph(6,y);
   g->Draw();
```

So, if we take the same example as above, and leave out the x-points, the diagram will look like this:

## Networking Libraries

### THttpServer

- upgrade civetweb code to version 1.15, supports SSL version 3.0
- resolve problem with symbolic links usage on Windows
- let disable/enable directory files listing via THttpServer (default is off)
- enable usage of unix sockets, used by `rootssh` script for tunnel to remote session


## GUI Libraries

- Provide web-based TTree viewer, integrated with RBrowser
- Support Edge browser on Windows for all kinds of web widgets
- Provide `rootssh` shell script to simplify use of web-based widgets on remote nodes:
```
   [localnode] rootssh user@remotenode
   [remotenode] root --web -e 'new TBrowser'
```
Script automatically configures ssh tunnel between local and remote nodes, one the remote node
unix socket with strict 0700 mode is used. When ROOT running on remote node wants to display
new web widget, script will automatically start web browser on local node with appropriate URL,
accessing widget via configured ssh tunnel.
