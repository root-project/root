## Deprecation and Removal

- The deprecated types `ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMerger` and `ROOT::Experimental::TBufferMergerFile` are removed.
Please use their non-experimental counterparts `ROOT::TBufferMerger` and `ROOT::TBufferMergerFile` instead.
- `ROOT::RVec::shrink_to_fit()` has now been removed after deprecation; it is not needed.
- `ROOT::RVec::emplace()` has now been removed after deprecation; please use `ROOT::RVec::insert()` instead.
- The deprecated function `ROOT::Detail::RDF::RActionImpl<Helper>::GetDataBlockCallback()` is removed; please use `GetSampleCallback()` instead.
- The deprecated RooFit containers `RooHashTable`, `RooNameSet`, `RooSetPair`, and `RooList` are removed. Please use STL container classes instead, like `std::unordered_map`, `std::set`, and `std::vector`.
- The `RooFit::FitOptions(const char*)` command to steer [RooAbsPdf::fitTo()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooAbsPdf.html) with an option string was removed. This way of configuring the fit was deprecated since at least since ROOT 5.02.
  Subsequently, the `RooMinimizer::fit(const char*)` function and the [RooMCStudy](https://root.cern.ch/doc/v628/classRooMCStudy.html) constructor that takes an option string was removed as well.
- The overload of `RooAbsData::createHistogram` that takes integer parameters for the bin numbers is now deprecated and will be removed in ROOT 6.30.
  This was done to avoid confusion with inconsistent behavior when compared to other `createHistogram` overloads.
  Please use the verson of `createHistogram` that takes RooFit command arguments.

### New features

- Add [`GraphAsymmErrors`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html#acea30792eef607489d498bf6547a00a6) action that fills a TGraphAsymmErrors object.

### Notable bug fixes and improvements

- Fix the node counter of [`SaveGraph`](https://root.cern/doc/master/namespaceROOT_1_1RDF.html#ac06a36e745255fb8744b1e0a563074c9), where previously `cling` was getting wrong static initialization.
- Fix [`Graph`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDF_1_1RInterface.html#a1ca9a94bece4767cac82968910afa02e) action (that fills a TGraph object) to properly handle containers and non-container types.

### Code modernization by using `std::string` in RooFit interfaces

The following lesser-used RooFit functions now return a `std::string` instead of a `const char*`, potentially requiring the update of your code:

- [std::string RooCmdConfig::missingArgs() const](https://root.cern/doc/v628/classRooCmdConfig.html#aec50335293c45a507d347c604bf9651f)
### Uniquely identifying RooArgSet and RooDataSet objects

Before v6.28, it was ensured that no `RooArgSet` and `RooDataSet` objects on the heap were located at an address that had already been used for an instance of the same class before.
With v6.28, this is not guaranteed anymore.
Hence, if your code uses pointer comparisons to uniquely identify RooArgSet or RooDataSet instances, please consider using the new `RooArgSet::uniqueId()` or `RooAbsData::uniqueId()`.

## Removal of HistoToWorkspaceFactory (non-Fast)

The original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` produced models that consisted of a
Poisson term for each bin.  In this "number counting form" the dataset has one
row and the collumns corresponded to the number of events for each bin. This
led to severe performance problems in statistical tools that generated
pseudo-experiments and evaluated likelihood ratio test statistics.

Nowadays, everyone uses the faster `HistoToWorkspaceFactoryFast` implementation that
produces a model in the "standard form" where the dataset has one row for each
event, and the column corresponds to the value of the observable in the
histogram. 

Therefore, the original `HistoToWorkspaceFactory` is now removed to avoid
confusion and maintainance burden.
