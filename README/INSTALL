1. Getting the source:
======================

To install ROOT from source you first have to get the tar file
containing the source. This tar file can be found in the usual
ROOT download area (ftp://root.cern.ch/root). The files are named
root-<version>.source.tar.gz.

Here's a short summary:

1) Get access to the FTP area (substitute any FTP client and appropriate
   email address below):

     prompt% ftp root.cern.ch
     User: anonymous
     Password: <your-email-address>

2) Go to the directory, and prepare for binary transfer of files:

     ftp> cd /root
     ftp> bin

3) Get the sources tar-ball (substitute the appropriate version
   number), and exit FTP client:

     ftp> get root-<version>.source.tar.gz
     ftp> bye

4) Unpack the distribution:

     prompt% gzip -dc root-<version>.source.tar.gz | tar -xf -

An alternative approach is to use our public Subversion repository to get
the latest version. See URL:
   http://root.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/ROOT/SubversionHowto

Here's a short summary:

1a) Get a specific version (>= 2.25/00), e.g.: version 2.25/03:

     prompt% svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/tags/v2-25-03 root

1b) Alternatively, checkout the head (development version) of the sources:

     prompt% svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk root

In both cases you should have a subdirectory called "root" in the
directory you ran the above commands in.


2. Getting ready to build:
==========================

You may want to compile features into ROOT, which depends on third
party libraries. Make sure you meet all demands for additional
features before trying to enable them (see below).

If you are using some Un*x, you need to have libXpm installed. On very
few systems libXpm.a is not available. In that case get the pre-built
version from:

   ftp://root.cern.ch/root/xpm.

Then use either environment variable XPM or "configure" flags
"--with-xpm-libdir=<dir>" to specify where you installed libXpm, if you
didn't install it in some generally searched directory (see more below).

If you are using Windows make sure you've installed Cygwin

   http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

and that it is setup correctly, see:

   http://root.cern.ch/root/Cygwin.html

Before proceeding read the complete document.  Note: With the advent
of Cygwin 1.0 your system is mostly setup correctly by the setup.exe
program.


3. Choosing the installation method:
====================================

There are two main methods of installing ROOT from source.  As an
alternative, you can build either a set of Debian GNU/Linux or Redhat
Linux packages.

3.1. Environment driven build:
------------------------------

You want to install in a generic directory, depending on environment
variables ROOTSYS, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and PATH.

   1) Get the sources of the latest ROOT (see above)

   2) Type the build commands:
        cd root
        ./configure --help
        ./configure <arch>        [change arch appropriately]
        (g)make                   [or, make -j n for n core machines]

   3) Add bin/ to PATH and lib/ to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. For the sh shell family do:
        . bin/thisroot.sh

      and for the csh shell family do:
        source bin/thisroot.csh

   4) try running root:
        root

3.2. Fixed locations build:
---------------------------

You want to install ROOT in a fixed location, not depending on
ROOTSYS. Typically you want to do this when installing in a location
like `/usr/local/bin' or even `/usr/bin'. This allows you, and all
others on your system, to run ROOT without having to setup ROOTSYS and
special PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables.

This scheme also makes it easier to make ROOT
distributions/installations that fit with an existing system. E.g., it
is trivial to install ROOT via a RedHat (.rpm) or Debian GNU/Linux
(.deb) package (see also below).

It's _strongly_ recommended to enable version numbers in sonames (if
possible) using this method (see --enable-soversion below). Also,
using the --enable-rpath option to "configure" you can set the load
path to the ROOT libraries on the applications. However, this is not
recommended if you have some other way (like /etc/ld.so.conf) of
making the dynamic loader aware of where you installed the ROOT
libraries.

   1) Get the sources of latest ROOT (see above)

   2) Now type the build commands:
        cd root
        ./configure --help
        ./configure <arch> --prefix=/usr/local [change arch appropriately]
        (g)make                 [or, make -j2, for dual CPU machines]
        (g)make install         [su to root if --prefix points to a system dir]

   3) Update the ldconfig cache by doing:
        ldconfig

   4) try running root:
        root

3.3. Redhat packages:
---------------------
Get the sources for a specific release from Subversion or from a tar-ball, as
outlined above and cd into the source directory. Then just do

        make redhat

This will create a RPM spec file in the source tree. To build the
packages do:

1) Make a tar-ball of the source tree:

        cd ../
        tar -czvf root-v<version>.source.tar.gz

  where <version>=<major>.<minor>.<revision> is the version number of
  ROOT (see the file build/version_number).

2)
  A) If you have system privileges, you can now do:

        cp root_v<version>.source.tar.gz /usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/

     or where ever RPM looks for source archives.

  B) However, if you don't have system privileges, you should set up a
     build area by having the file ~/.rpmrc with a contents like:

        %macrofiles: /usr/lib/rpm/macros:<your home dir>/.rpmmac

     and a file <your home dir>/.rpmmac with a contents like:

        %_topdir <some where you can write>/redhat

     Then you should make the appropriate directories:

        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat
        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat/SOURCES
        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat/BUILD
        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat/RPMS
        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat/SRPMS
        mkdir <some where you can write>/redhat/SPECS

     and finally copy the source tar-ball:

        cp root_v<version>.source.tar.gz \
           <some where you can write>/redhat/SOURCES

3) Wether you have system privileges or not, you can now build the RPM
   packages by issuing (Red Hat 7.3 or less):

       rpm -ba root.spec

   or (Red Hat 8.0 or above):

       rpmbuild -ba root.spec

  If you left the spec file in the source tree, you can build directly
  from the tar-ball.  You still need to have a proper build area
  setup, as outlined above.  All you need to do is:

       rpm -ta root_v<version>.source.tar.gz        (Red Hat 7.3-)
       rpmbuild -ta root_v<version>.source.tar.gz   (Red Hat 8.0+)

Per default the binaries will be build in /tmp/rootrpm, but one may
change that at build time by passing the option --buildroot too rpm.

Please refer to man-page rpm(1) and http://www.rpm.org for more
information on RPM.

Please note, that all possible packages may not be specified in the
spec file.  See also build/package/common/README.

3.4. Debian GNU/Linux packages:
-------------------------------
Get the sources for a specific release from Subversion or from a tar-ball, as
outlined above and cd into the source directory. Then just do

        make debian

The packages will be build in "../".

Please note, that all possible packages may not be specified in the
debian directory file.  See also build/package/common/README.

4. Installation Location:
=========================

By default, the system will be installed depending on the ROOTSYS
environment variable. In that case the whole package will live under
the directory ROOTSYS points to.

Using the fixed location mode (section 3.2), the default `--prefix'
path is `/usr/local', which will result in the ROOT files to be
installed in `/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib', etc. You can specify
an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure'
the option `--prefix=PATH'. For more detailed location specifications
see `configure --help'.

Here's the complete list:

* prefix (/usr/local)
  Installation prefix. This will prefix any installation directory not
  explicitly specified.
* bindir (<prefix>/bin)
  This is where the ROOT applications (root, cint, rootcint, etc.)
  will be installed.
* libdir (<prefix>/lib/root)
  Library installation directory. All the class libraries of ROOT will
  be installed into this directory. You should make your dynamic
  linker aware of this directory. On Linux - and some other Un*ces -
  this directory can be added to /etc/ld.so.conf and ldconfig should
  be run afterward (you need to be root - the user - to do
  this). Please note, that this directory should probably not be
  something like /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib, since you'll most likely
  get a name clash with ROOT libraries and other libraries
  (e.g. libMatrix.so); rather use something like /usr/local/lib/root
* incdir (<prefix>/include/root)
  Header installation directory. All the header (declaration) files
  for the ROOT classes will be installed into this directory. This
  should be parallel to libdir, for consistency.
* etcdir (<prefix>/etc/root)
  Configuration files installation directory. The system-wide
  system.rootrc and root.mimes will be installed into this directory.
* mandir (<prefix>/share/man/man1)
  Installation directory for the ROOT man(1) pages. This should be
  somewhere searched by man(1). On most Un*x you can set the search
  path for man(1) via environment variable MANPATH. On some systems, a
  special configuration file /etc/manpath.config exist and should be
  used. See also man(1) - type man man in the prompt - on your
  system.
* datadir (<prefix>/share/root)
  Top-level data installation directory. Under this directory, various
  data files needed by ROOT will be installed, either in
  subdirectories, or directly.
* proofdir (<datadir>/proof)
  PROOF utilities directory. Various PROOF utility scripts as well as
  example configurations are installed into this directory.
* macrodir (<datadir>/macros)
  Macro installation directory. Macros - properly called scripts -
  provided by the ROOT system are installed into this directory. ROOT
  - the application -  will always search this directory for scripts.
* cintincdir (<datadir>/cint)
  CINT data directory. In this directory, the CINT runtime headers
  will be installed, both the standard headers, as well as
  pre-processed once.
* iconpath (<datadir>/icons)
  Icon installation directory. The icons used by the TBrowser and other
  classes will be installed into this directory. The user can specify
  additional directories in using the "--with-sysicondir" option.
* srcdir (<datadir>/src)
  Sources installation directory. Currently not used!
* docdir (<prefix>/doc/root)
  Documentation, like the LICENCE, README, etc. files will be
  installed into this directory.
* testdir (<docdir>/test)
  The test applications and libraries will be installed here.
* tutdir (<docdir>/tutorial)
  All the tutorials will be installed in this directory.


5. Makefile targets:
====================

The Makefile system and supported make targets are explained in the
BUILDSYSTEM file.


6. Installing optional add-on libraries:
========================================

There are two ways in which you can specify additional features to
build into the ROOT system:

6.1. Using the environment:
---------------------------

If you want to compile the ROOT optional add-on libraries to handle
True Type fonts, OpenGL graphics, SRP authentication, MySQL access,
RFIO access and event generator interfaces (Pythia, Pythia6 and
Venus) you can either specify the options as environment variables.
For example:

  # Used during build of ROOT can be overridden in ./configure
  export ROOTBUILD=debug      # see $ROOTSYS/README/BUILDSYSTEM
  export CERNLIB=~/cernlib    # must contain libpacklib.a libkernlib.a
  export RFIO=~/shift/lib     # CERN's SHIFT library, must
                              # contain libshift.a
  export OPENGL=~/Mesa        # must contain include/ lib/
  export SRP=~/src/srp        # must contain include/ lib/
  #export AFS=                # must contain include/ lib/
  #export XPM=                # must contain libXpm
  #export MYSQL=              # must contain include/ lib/
  #export PYTHIA=             # must contain libPythia
  #export PYTHIA6=            # must contain libPythia6
  #export VENUS=              # must contain libVenus
  #export TABLE=yes           # to build the Table contrib library

The ROOTBUILD environment variable is special and architecture
dependent. To get an idea of which values it can take, take a look in
the config/Makefile.<architecture> corresponding to your
architecture.


6.2. Using "configure" flags:
-----------------------------

You can also specify additional features and external linking using
command line options - or flags - to the configure script.

A special flag is "--build=<option list>" which correspond to the
ROOTBUILD environment variable, as described above.

The flags consist of two classes:

1) --enable-<feature>/--disable-<feature> flags:
   These flags enables/disables support for the corresponding feature
   <feature>. Specifying such a flag will make the configure script
   look for third-party libraries, headers, etc. at default
   locations.

   If you find that the default locations does not work with some
   standard path e.g., on OS <Foo>, library lib<Bar>, is in general
   installed in path <Baz>, but "configure" doesn't look there, please
   file a bug report with rootbugs@root.cern.ch.

   If, for some reason, you have installed some third-party library
   outside it's usual location, you can make "configure" look for it
   using the corresponding "--with-<feature dir>" option (see below).

   By default, all features are enabled, except for a few cases (noted
   below).

   Here's a list of supported features:

   * shared
     Use shared 3rd party libraries if possible. Some platforms assume
     this by default, others do not support it at all. Default is true.
   * rpath
     Set library path on executables. This is only supported on some
     platforms. Default is false.
   * soversion
     Include the major version number of ROOT in the soname of the
     shared libraries. This means that you'll have an additional check
     on whether your applications are linked to the proper runtime
     libraries. It's strongly encouraged to use this option. This
     options is only supported on some platforms. Default is false.
   * table
     Build Table contributed library, including new containers and
     extended 3D geometry descriptions. Default is false.
   * thread
     Compile ROOT thread safe, as well as a thread API library. This
     options is strongly recommended. This requires the system library
     libpthread (Posix threads). Default is false, except for the
     "linux" architecture.
   * opengl
     OpenGL (3D rendering and visualisation) support. This is
     especially powerful if you have a 3D accelerated card and a
     proper OpenGL interface for your graphics system. This requires
     the third party libraries libGL and libGLU - or libMesaGL and
     libMesaGLU, as well header files for these libraries. For
     platforms with native OpenGL support (Windows), this is always
     enabled, even if the --disable-opengl flag is set. Default is true.
   * cern
     Build h2root and g2root utilities to convert ZEBRA files with
     HBOOK histograms and/or Ntuple, and GEANT geometries
     respectively, into ROOT structures in ROOT files. This requires
     the third-party libraries libkernlib and libpacklib from the
     CERNLIB distribution. Default is true.
   * mysql
     Build a thin MySQL client for ROOT. This requires the third-party
     library libmysqlclient and header files. Note that there may be
     licensing issues regarding linking against libmysqlclient.
     Default is true.
   * psql
     Build a thin PostGreSQL client for ROOT. This requires the
     third-party library libpsql and header files.
     Default is true.
   * sapdb
     Build a thin SapDB client for ROOT. This requires the
     third-party library libsql and header files.
     Default is true.
   * shift
     Interface to SHIFT managed tape robots. This option requires you
     get the libshift.a from CERN. Please note, that this library is
     only available as a static library (archive), and will always be
     statically linked in. There may be licensing issues involved.
     Default is true.
   * pythia
     Build thin wrapper for the Pythia Event Generator (version
     5). This requires the third party library libPythia. Default is true.
   * pythia6
     Build thin wrapper for the Pythia Event Generator (version
     6). This requires the third party library libPythia6. Default is true.
   * venus
     Build thin wrapper for the Venus Event Generator. This requires
     the third party library libVenus. Default is true.
   * srp
     Build daemons rootd and proofd with SRP support. This requires
     the full third-party SRP distribution to be installed and build.
     Default is true.
   * afs
     Build daemons rootd and proofd with AFS support. This requires
     the third-party AFS libs and objects. Default is false.

2) --with-<feature dir>=<dir> flags:
   If "configure" isn't able to find some third-party library, header,
   or other file, corresponding to one of the above features, you can
   force it to look for these files in specific directories, using the
   "--with-" options.

   Using a "--with-<feature dir>=<dir>" will make "configure" look for
   whatever needed by <feature> in <dir>, and will also enable the
   corresponding feature. Hence, you do not need to specify
   "--enable-<feature>" if you give an "--with-<featuredir>=<dir>".
   The inverse - of course - isn't true.

   Here is a list of "--with-" flags:

   * xpm-libdir
     Directory containing libXpm.{so,a}. This option is special, since
     this doesn't correspond to any feature, as described
     above. However, the XPM library is needed on Un*x, and if
     installed somewhere non-standard, this option may help you.
   * thread-libdir
     Directory containing libpthread.{so,a} (Posix thread
     library). It's highly unlikely that you need to specify this
     option, since libpthread is completely standard on Un*x, and
     should be found by "configure".
   * sys-iconpath
     Extra icon path for TBrowser, etc. This, again doesn't correspond
     to any feature, but provides you with way of getting the TBrowser
     and others to look for additional icons in some system-wide
     directory.
   * opengl-incdir
     Directory containing GL/gl.h (note the sub-directory), needed by
     feature opengl.
   * opengl-libdir
     Directory containing libGL.{so,a} and libGLU.{so,a} -
     alternatively libMesaGL.{so,a} and libMesaGLU.{so,a} - needed by
     feature opengl.
   * mysql-incdir
     Directory containing mysql.h, needed by feature mysql.
   * mysql-libdir
     Directory containing libmysqlclient.{so,a}, needed by feature mysql.
   * pythia-libdir
     Directory containing libPythia.{so,a}, needed by feature pythia.
   * pythia6-libdir
     Directory containing libPythia6.{so,a}, needed by feature pythia6.
   * venus-libdir
     Directory containing libVenus.{so,a}, needed by feature venus.
   * cern-libdir
     Directory containing libpacklib.{so,a} and libkernlib.{so,a},
     needed by feature cern, for the ZEBRA file converters.
   * shift-libdir
     Directory containing libshift.a, needed for feature shift.
   * krb5
     Kerberos5 ditribution location
   * krb5-incdir
     Kerberos5 support, location of krb5.h
   * krb5-libdir
     Kerberos5 support, location of libkrb5
   * srp-incdir
     Path to header files for regular SRP library (not utilities)
     This is needed for building the daemons rootd and proofd with
     SRP support (authentication).
   * srp-libdir
     Path to regular SRP library (not utilities). This is needed for
     building the daemons rootd and proofd with SRP support
     (authentication).
   * srp
     Top directory of the SRP (Secure Remote Passwd). This directory
     must contain:
          base/libmisc/libmisc.a
          base/lib/libshadow.a
          base/lib/pwauth.h
          libsrp/libsrp.a
          libsrp/t_server.h
     And alternatively
          lib/libgmp.a
          lib/libcrack.a
     This is needed to build the utility programs for managing ROOT
     related SRP access.
   * afs
     Top directory of the AFS distribution. This directory must
     contain:
          lib/libubik.a
          lib/librxkad.a
          lib/libdes.a
          lib/librx.a
          lib/liblwp.a
          lib/afs/libkauth.a
          lib/afs/libprot.a
          lib/afs/libauth.a
          lib/afs/libsys.a
          lib/afs/libcmd.a
          lib/afs/libcom_err.a
          lib/afs/libaudit.a
          lib/afs/util.a
     This is needed for building the daemons rootd and proofd with
     AFS support (authentication).
   * globus
     Path to Globus Tool Kit installation, usually pointed to by the
     variable GLOBUS_LOCATION; the specification of this path supersedes
     the one defined by such variable.
     This directory must contain:
          include/openssl/x509.h
          include/openssl/pem.h
          include/globus_gss_assist.h
          lib/libglobus_gss_assist_<flavour>
          lib/libglobus_gssapi_gsi_<flavour>
          lib/libssl_<flavour>
          lib/libcrypto_<flavour>
     'configure' will also look for
          etc/globus-user-env.sh
          bin/grid-proxy-init
     and issue a warning if they are missing, since in such a case
     automatic credential initialization will not be available.
   * globus-patch
     Path to Globus Tool Kit sources; need for applying the experimental
     patch (see README.GLOBUS)


7. Information on third party software:
=======================================

The optional add-ons are not necessary for the proper functioning of
ROOT but we advice you to at least get the True Type fonts since they
hugely increase the appearance of text on the screen.


7.1. Posix Thread usage:
------------------------
To build the library providing thread support you need to have the
library libpthread.{a,so} and header files installed. This is usually
the case for any Un*x OS. For architecture "linux" thread support
will always be build.


7.2. OpenGL library:
--------------------
On how to get an open source version of OpenGL see:

   http://www.mesa3d.org

For prebuilt versions see:

   ftp://root.cern.ch/root/opengl/

Most Linux distributions come with a Mesa package, providing the
needed headers and libraries. Also, the OpenGL libraries are already
in XFree86 version 4 or above.


7.3. SHIFT managed tape I/O:
----------------------------
To build the library providing CERN RFIO (remote I/O) support you need
to get the "libshift.a" library from CERN. You can get pre-build
libraries from

  http://root.cern.ch/root/shift

or you can download the full source from

  http://savannah.cern.ch/files/?group=castor

7.4. ZEBRA file conversion tools:
---------------------------------
To build the HBOOK and Geant3 conversion programs `h2root' and
`g2root' you need the CERNLIB components "libpacklib.{a,so}" and
"libkernlib.{a,so}" from CERN. You can get it from

  ftp://asisftp.cern.ch/cernlib


7.5. MySQL client:
------------------
To build the MySQL interface library you need to install MySQL first. See:

   http://www.mysql.com/


7.6. PostGreSQL Client:
-----------------------
To build the PostGreSQL interface you need to install PostGreSQL
first. See

   http://www.postgresql.org


7.7.  SapDB Client:
-------------------
To build the SapDB interface you need to install the SapDB calling
interface first, which can be found in the rpm sapdb-callif-xxxx. See

   http://www.sapdb.org


7.8. Pythia Event Generators:
-----------------------------
To build the event generator interfaces for Pythia and Pythia6, you
first have to get the pythia libraries. You can get pre-build
libraries from:

   ftp://root.cern.ch/root/pythia/

or you can download the source from the same directory. The original
sources can be found via Lunds FTP server.

More information is available from:

   http://www.thep.lu.se/~torbjorn/Pythia.html


7.9. Venus Event Generators:
----------------------------
To build the event generator interface for Venus, you need to have the
Venus libraries.  The sources can be downloaded from

    ftp://root.cern.ch/root/venus/

7.10. Secure Remote Password (SRP) Authentication:
--------------------------------------------------
To build the strong authentication module used by rootd and proofd,
you first have to install the SRP (Secure Remote Password)
system. See:

   http://srp.stanford.edu/

Please note, that the library "libsrp-dev" as distributed by Standford
is not enough to build the two utility program in the srputil
directory of the ROOT source tree.


7.11. AFS Authentication:
-------------------------
To build rootd and proofd with support for AFS authentication, you
first have to install AFS client libraries system. There are a few AFS
distributions available.

* OpenAFS
  IBMs OpenSource AFS distribution - see

    http://www.openafs.org

* Transarc AFS
  IBMs commercial AFS ditribution - see

    http://www.transarc.ibm.com/Support/afs


7.12. Kerberos Authentication:
------------------------------
To build the Kerberos authentication module used by rootd and proofd,
you first have to install Kerberos V on your machine. See:

   http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/

for details and downloads.
If the installation directory is different from the standard ones
(typically /usr/kerberos) the --with-krb5=<krb5_dir> flag must be
used to tell configure where to look for Kerberos. Alternatrively
the --with-krb5-incdir and --with-krb5-libdir can be specified
individually.


7.13. Globus Authentication:
----------------------------
To build the Globus authentication module used by rootd and proofd,
you first have to make sure that the Globus Tool Kit is installed
on the machine. See:

   http://www.globus.org/

for details and downloads.
Globus Tool Kit is available only for a subset of Unix platforms.
The variable GLOBUS_LOCATION should be defined as the directory
containing Globus lib, include and bin. For compilation purposes
you can pass this directory to the configure script with the option
--with-globus-dir=<globus_dir>. An experimental path is available
for versions 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 of the Globus Tool Kit to fix a small
bug preventing full functionallity of the root implementation; this
is activated by setting --with-globus-patch-dir=<globus_src_dir>
where <globus_src_dir> is the globus tool kit source,


7.14. SSH Authentication:
-------------------------
There is no need to build special modules for SSH authentication.
