<h3>Core</h3>
<h4>Build system and Platform support</h4>
<ul>
<li>The build system has been extended to support out-of-source builds.
This means you can build different sets of binaries from one source tree, like:
<pre>
      mkdir root-debug
      cd root-debug
      ../root/configure --build=debug
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The build system now supports cross compilation, where typically you need tools
like rootcint, rootmap, etc, to be compiled on the build platform to be able
to generate dictionaries for the target platform.
</li>
<li>ROOT has been ported to iOS. This port required the above mentioned
changes in the build system. To build ROOT for the iPhone/iPad sumilator do:
<pre>
    ./configure iossim
    make
</pre>
To build a native iOS armv7 version do:
<pre>
    ./configure ios
    make
</pre>
Both builds create a libRoot.a that can be used to create ROOT based iOS apps
(iOS does not allow apps to load non-system dynamic libraries at run time).
Some sample Xcode projects using ROOT will soon be made available.
</ul>
<h4>Base</h4>
<ul>
<li>Change TTime data member from Long_t to Long64_t. On 32-bit systems the
Long_t is 32-bits and too small to keep the time in milliseconds since the ROOT EPOCH (1-1-1995). Added new operators:
<pre>
operator long long()
operator unsigned long long()
</pre>
The existing operators long and unsigned long on 32-bit machines return
an error in case the stored time is larger then 32-bit and truncation
occurs (like was always the case till now, but silently).
</li>
<li>New method ExitOnException() which allows to set the behaviour of
TApplication in case of an exception (sigsegv, sigbus, sigill, sigfpe).
The default is to trap the signal and continue with the event loop,
using this method one can specify to exit with the signal number to the
shell, or to abort() which in addition generates a core dump.
</li>
<li>New command line argument -x which forces ROOT to exit on an exception.</li>
<li>Add TSystem::AddDynamicPath.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Build</h4>
<ul>
<li>New option '-t' for rmkdepend to allow the caller to fully specify the name to be used as a target
This supersedes the name calculated from the input file name and the -p and -o option.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>ACLiC</h4>
<ul>
<li>Allow ACLiC to use a flat directory structure when a build directory is specified.
To use a flat structure do:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   gSystem->SetBuildDir(whereIwant, kTRUE); // the default for the 2nd parameter is kFALSE
</pre>
Or use '-' in the option of CompileMacro
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   gSystem->CompileMacro(myscript,"k-",...);
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Meta</h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement polymorphism for Emulated object (still not supporting polymorphism
of Emulated Object inheriting from compiled class).
This avoids memory leaks when the user data model relies on polymorphism
and does not the shared library defining the classes theand avoid splicing if the data is copied.
<br/>
<tt>TStreamerInfo::New</tt> inserts the address of the creating <tt>TStreamerInfo</tt> into
the object.  This address is inserted in each emulated that does not inherit
from an emulated class and is positioned after all the base classes (which
are compiled classes).   A derived class will set this value inside each
of its emulated base class.<br/>
<tt>TStreamerInfo::Destruct</tt> and the new method <tt>TStreamerInfo::GetActualClass</tt>
use this information to detect the TStreamerInfo actually used to create
the object and hence run the proper emulated destructor.</li>
<br>
<li>Add a new function GenerateDictionary to TInterpreter which allows for the quick and easy creation of a dictionary
given one (or more) class name(s) and the name(s) of its header files.
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   gInterpreter->GenerateDictionary("vector&lt;vector&lt;float&gt; &gt;;list&lt;vector&lt;float&gt; &gt;","list;vector");
   gInterpreter->GenerateDictionary("myclass","myclass.h;myhelper.h");
</pre>This replaces the recommendation of creating a small 'loader.C' script to create the dictionaries.
</li>
<li>Implement a ShowMembers function for interpreted classes, by querying the interpreter for the data member
information.</li>
<li>In order to fix possible buffer overflow of parent string buffer in TMemberInspector,
the signature of ShowMember() was changed to no longer require (nor request) the
caller to provide a buffer (of length unknown to the callee.)</li>
<li>Improve the uniqueness of globally visible symbols to allow for the mixing of
dictionaries with very similar layout.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cont</h4>
<ul>
<li>New functions for TClonesArray:
<ul>
<li>
AbsorbObjects(TClonesArray* otherTCA):
Allows one to directly move the object pointers from otherTCA to the calling
TCA without cloning (copying). The calling TCA takes over ownership of all of
the moved objects. otherTCA is left empty upon return.
</li>
<li>
MultiSort(Int_t nTCs, TClonesArray** tcs):
Sorts multiple TClonesArrays simultaneously using the calling TCA's objects
as the sorting key.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>New function for TSeqCollection:

QSort(Object **a, Int_t nBs, TObject ***b):
Sort array a of TObject pointers using a quicksort algorithm. Arrays b will
be sorted just like a (a determines the sort; nBs is the number of TObject**
arrays in b). Uses ObjCompare() to compare objects. This function is used by
the new function TClonesArray::MultiSort().
</li>
<li>Add a new option "+" in TClonesArray::Clear.   When the option starts with "C+",
eg "C+xyz" the objects in the array are in turn cleared with the option "xyz".</li>
<li>Since the Collection objects do have a name and the Clone method does allow
for the name to change, TCollection::Clone was added to implement the name change properly.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thread</h4>
<ul>
<li>New static function TThread::IsInitialized
</li>
</ul>
