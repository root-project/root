<h3>Build System</h3>

<h4>MacOS X</h4>
<ul>
<li>
On MacOS X move to a more secure way of building. We will now always use
the --enable-explicitlink ./configure option which will cause a shared lib
or executable to be linked with all its dependent libraries. The OSX linker
is quite good and processing this extended set of libraries for each link
does cost only 3s extra time for all 100+ shared libs (13s instead of 10s).
Not much for the extra security. In addition we went back to the default
linker option "-undefined error", so you will get an error if symbols
are unresolved. Shared libs are also linked with the option
"-Wl,-dead_strip_dylibs" which tells the linker to remove any shared lib
which is not used to resolve any symbols (this should
solve the long standing issue of ACliC linking all previously created
shared libs even when not needed).
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Linux</h4>
<ul>
<li>
Make --enable-explictlink the default on linux too (was already the case for:
macosx, freebsd, openbsd, aix and win32). This adds some extra time to
the link stage, which can be recuperated by using the newer, much faster,
gold linker. In addition we added the linker option "-Wl,--no-undefined",
so you will get an error if symbols are unresolved.
Explicit linking is required by newer distributions, like Ubuntu 11.10,
that require all dependent shared libs to be specified when linking. They
also have default options set to dead strip shared libs that don't resolve
any symbols (equivalent to the MacOS X build changes described above).
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Core Libraries</h3>


<h4>TClonesArray</h4>

<ul>
<li>Introduce <tt>TClonesArray::ConstructedAt</tt> which
always returns an already constructed object.   If the slot is being used for the
first time, it calls the default constructor otherwise it returns the object as
is (unless a string is passed as the 2nd argument to the function in which case,
it also calls Clear(second_argument) on the object).
This allows to replace code like:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; ev-&gt;Ntracks; i++) {
       new(a[i]) TTrack(x,y,z,...);
       ...
       ...
   }
   ...
   a.Delete(); // or a.Clear("C")
</pre>
with the simpler and more efficient:
<pre style="border:gray 1px solid;padding:0.5em 2em;background:#ffe">
   for (int i = 0; i &lt; ev-&gt;Ntracks; i++) {
       TTrack *track = (TTrack*)a.ConstructedAt(i);
       track->Set(x,y,z,....);
       ...
       ...
   }
   ...
   a.Clear();
</pre>
even in case where the TTrack class allocates memory.
</li>
<li>TClonesArray: update ExpandCreateFast to also reset the non-used slots
so that calling Clear (which does too much) is no longer necessary
when using ExpandCreateFast.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>New Thread Pool class</h4>
<ul>
<li>
A first version of TThreadPool class has been introduced.
This class implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern">a Thread Pool pattern</a>.
So far it supports only one type of queue - FIFO.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Thread library</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reduces risk of internal dead lock by using a private internal lock to protect the internals of TThread, rather than using TThread::Lock
</li>
<li>New header TThreadSlots.h to centralize and formalize the use of the TThread local memory slots amongst the ROOT packages.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Global Variables</h4>
<ul>
<li>The global values gPad, gVirtualX, gInterpreter, gDirectory and gFile
are now all accessed via a static function of their respective class.  The
access is made transparent via a CPP macro.</li>
<li>The access is now also made transparent from the CINT and python prompt.</li>
<li>gPad, gVirtualX and gInterpreter are now accessible even when their value
is zero and they now properly support tab completion.</li>
<li>See the important note in the I/O section on gDirectory and gFile which
are now thread local.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Meta</h4>
<ul>
<li>The new interface <tt>TDictionary::GetDictionary(const char*)</tt> offers a
single entry point to query the type based on its name, conveniently combining
TDataType and TClass queries. It does name normalization (removing std etc).
</li>
<li>Add the ability to explicitly forbid (or allow) the splitting of a class
(<tt>TClass::SetSplit</tt>) so that user can inforce the use of a custom streamer in all possible split cases.
</li>
<li>Resolve several issues with the creation of StreamerInfo for abstract classes.
</li>

<li>When looking for the value corresponding to an enum type, skip global that are not enums. (This improves the speed of TFile::Open by 60%).
</li>
</ul>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<ul>
<li>
The Modern style has now a transparent background for the histogram title.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Misc.</h4>
<ul>
<li>In the root executable, auto-detect command line arguments that are local root files even if their name does not end with ".root"
</li>
<li>If home directory is not correctly set in pw file or user is not known, use the HOME shell variable to find the desired home directory.
</li>
</ul>
