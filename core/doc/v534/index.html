<h4>ROOT Error Handlers</h4>
<p>There is a new rootrc variable which allows to control the
installation of the ROOT error handlers. By default the handlers
are activated:</p>
<pre>
   Root.ErrorHandlers:      1
</pre>
<p>but setting the value to 0 result in no error handlers being installed
and the originals remaining in place. This can be useful if ROOT is used in
conjunction with other frameworks that already installed their own handlers.
</p>

<h4>TString</h4>
<p>TString::Hash() and thus also TMath::Hash() now use <tt>MurmurHash3_x64_128</tt>
from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/">http://code.google.com/p/smhasher/</a> which is public domain.
To accelerate the hash in the case of pointers even further, pointers (and same-sized texts) are hashed using a simple bitwise xor.
This dramatically increases the hash performance for long texts, and still by a factor 5 for pointers.
The pointer case is most visible for certain I/O operations (TExMap).</p>

<h4>TColor</h4>
<p>Add the method <tt>SetAlpha()</tt> to set the alpha value (transparency
level) for an existing color.
</p>

<h4>TStyle</h4>
<p>
The default font set by <tt>gStyle->SetLegendFont()</tt> was ignored.
</p>
