\brief The Base classes of ROOT.

The base classes of the ROOT system provide the core of the system. They
are available to all other classes. They range from a set of abstract
interfaces (TVirtualXXXXX classes), to a wide range of basic utility
classes providing basic services like strings, regular expression,
timers, date/time, md5 checksumming, signal/slots event handling,
plugin handler, run-config resource processor, etc. etc.
