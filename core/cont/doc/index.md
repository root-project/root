\brief The containers and generators the ROOT framework offers.

Collections are a key feature of the ROOT system. Many, if not most, of
the applications you write will use collections. If you have used
polymorphic C++ collections before, some of this material will be review.
However, much of [this tutorial](https://github.com/root-project/root/blob/master/test/tcollex.cxx)
covers aspects of collections specific to the ROOT system.
In this tutorial the following features will be demonstrated:

  - Using collections
  - How to create instances of collections
  - The difference between lists, ordered collections, hash-tables, maps, etc.
  - How to add and remove elements of a collection
  - How to search a collection for a specific element
  - How to access and modify collection elements
  - How to iterate over a collection
  - How to manage memory for collections and collection elements
  - How collection elements are tested for equality (`IsEqual()`)
  - How collection elements are compared (`Compare()`) in case of sorted collections
  - How collection elements are hashed (`Hash()`) in hash tables
