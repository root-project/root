<p>The TextInput library is used by ROOT (TRint, specifically) to read input on the prompt. It does e.g. syntax highlighting and history management, understands all supported terminals and all of that as a stand-alone package, without dependency on the (old, big, non-Windows) [n]curses library.</p>
