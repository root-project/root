   Since no alignment guarantees are made about the initial value returned
   by sbrk, test the initial value and (if necessary) sbrk enough additional
   memory to start off with alignment to BLOCKSIZE.  We actually only need
   it aligned to an alignment suitable for any object, so this is overkill.
   But at most it wastes just part of one BLOCKSIZE chunk of memory and
   minimizes portability problems by avoiding us having to figure out
   what the actual minimal alignment is.  The rest of the malloc code
   avoids this as well, by always aligning to the minimum of the requested
   size rounded up to a power of two, or to BLOCKSIZE.

   Note that we are going to use some memory starting at this initial sbrk
   address for the sbrk region malloc descriptor, which is a struct, so the
   base address must be suitably aligned. */
