   Returns the malloc descriptor on failure, which can subsequently be used
   for further action, such as obtaining more information about the nature of
   the failure by examining the preserved errno value.

   Note that the malloc descriptor that we are using is currently located in
   region we are about to unmap, so we first make a local copy of it on the
