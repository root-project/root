The following is a description of the association between the 'core' libraries
and executable(s) and the sub-directories of the directory named 'core'.  When
using the verb 'contains' we mean "contains .o files generated from the source
files in the following (sub)directories."

rootcling_stage1 executable contains:
  - clib
  - foundation
  - clingutils
  - dictgen
  - rootcling_stage1

Note: The public version of rootcling is hosted (outside of core) in the
directory/package named 'main' 'and depends on libCore, libCling, libRIO
and io/rootpcm.

libCore does a dlopen of libCling and contains:
  - clib
  - foundation
  - base
  - cont
  - meta
  - textinput
and depending on the platform
  - macosx
  - unix
  - winnt
and optionaly
  - lzma
  - lz4
  - zip

libCling depends on libCore and libRIO and contains:
  - clingutils
  - dictgen
  - metacling

The code in metacling and dictgen that uses libRIO should be moved to
io/rootpcm to remove the dependency on libRIO, see ROOT-8512.

libThread depends on libCore and contains:
  - thread

libNew depends on libCore and contains:
  - newdelete

libRint depends on libCore and contains:
  - rint

libMultiProc depends on explicitly on libCore, libNet, libTreePlayer and
implicit on libRIO, libTree, libGraf3d, libGraf, libHist, libGpad and
libMathCore and contains:
   - multiproc

libMultiProc should be moved to a different package due to its depencies,
see ROOT-8513.
