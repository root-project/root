/// This macro demonstrates how to set up a fit in two ranges
/// such that it does not only fit the shapes in each region, but also
/// takes into account the relative normalization of the two.
///
/// ### 1. Shape fits (plain likelihood)
///
/// If you perform a fit in two ranges in RooFit, e.g. `pdf->fitTo(data,Range("Range1,Range2"))`
/// it will construct a simple simultaneous fit of the two regions.
///
/// In case the pdf is not extended, i.e., a shape fit, it will only fit the shapes in the
/// two selected ranges, and not take into account the relative predicted yields in those ranges.
///
/// In certain models (like exponential decays) and configurations (e.g. narrow ranges that are far apart),
/// the relative normalization of the ranges may carry much more information about the function parameters
/// than the shape of the distribution inside those ranges. Therefore, it is important to take that into
/// account.
///
/// This is particularly important for cases where the 2-range fit is meant to be representative of
/// a full-range fit, but with a blinded signal region inside it.
///
///
/// ### 2. Shape+rate fits (extended likelihood)
///
/// Also if your pdf is already extended, i.e. measuring both the distribution in the observable as well
/// as the event count in the fitted region, some intervention is needed to make fits in ranges
/// work in a way that corresponds to intuition.
///
/// If an extended fit is performed in a sub-range, the observed yield is only that of the subrange, hence
/// the expected event count will converge to a number that is smaller than what's visible in a plot.
/// In such cases, it is often preferred to interpret the extended term with respect to the full range
/// that's plotted, i.e., apply a correction to the extended likelihood term in such a way
/// that the interpretation of the expected event count remains that of the full range. This can
/// be done by applying a correcion factor (equal to the fraction of the pdf that is contained in the
/// fitted range) in the Poisson term that represents the extended likelihood term.
///
/// If an extended likelihood fit is performed over *two* sub-ranges, this correction is
/// even more important: without it, each component likelihood would have a different interpretation
/// of the expected event count (each corresponding to the count in its own region), and a joint
/// fit of these regions with different interpretations of the same model parameter results
/// in a number that is not easily interpreted.
///
/// If both regions correct their interpretatin such that N_expected refers to the full range,
/// it is interpreted easily, and consistent in both regions.
///
/// This requires that the likelihood model is extended using RooAddPdf in the
/// form SumPdf = Nsig * sigPdf + Nbkg * bkgPdf.

 // Construct an extended pdf, which measures the event count N **on the full range**.
 // If the actual domain of x that is fitted is identical to FULL, this has no affect.
 //
 // If the fitted domain is a subset of `FULL`, though, the expected event count is divided by

 //     \int_{\mathrm{Full range}} \mathrm{model}(x) \; \mathrm{d}x }.

 // `N` will therefore return the count extrapolated to the full range instead of the fit range.
 //
 // **Note**: When using a RooAddPdf for extending the likelihood, the same effect can be achieved with
 // [RooAddPdf::fixCoefRange()](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classRooAddPdf.html#ab631caf4b59e4c4221f8967aecbf2a65),

 // It can be instructive to fit the above model to either the LEFT or RIGHT range. `N` should approximately converge to the expected number
 // of events in the full range. One may try to leave out `"FULL"` in the constructor, o the the interpretation of `N` changes.
 extmodel.fitTo(*data, Range("LEFT"), PrintLevel(-1));
 N.Print();


 // If we now do a simultaneous fit to the extended model, instead of the original model, the LEFT and RIGHT range will each correct their local
 // `N` such that it refers to the `FULL` range.
 //
 // This joint fit of the extmodel will include (w.r.t. the plain model fit) a product of extended terms
 // \f[
 //     L_\mathrm{ext} = L
 //       \cdot \mathrm{Poisson} \left( N_\mathrm{obs}^\mathrm{LEFT}  | N_\mathrm{exp} / \mathrm{frac LEFT} \right)
 //       \cdot \mathrm{Poisson} \left( N_\mathrm{obs}^\mathrm{RIGHT} | N_\mathrm{exp} / \mathrm{frac RIGHT} \right)
 // \f]
 // that will introduce additional sensitivity of the likelihood to the slope parameter alpha of the exponential model through the `frac_LEFT` and `frac_RIGHT` integrals.
 //
 // In the extreme case of an exponential function and a fit in narrow LEFT and RIGHT ranges, this sensitivity may actually be larger
 // than from the shapes.
 //
 // This is also nicely demonstrated in the example below where the uncertainty on alpha is almost 5x smaller if the extended term is included.
