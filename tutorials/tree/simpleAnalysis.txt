# Example analysis illustrating the use of rootdrawtree / TSimpleAnalysis.
# Run as:
#  $ rootdrawtree tutorials/tree/simpleAnalysis.txt

file_output.root   #the output file in which histograms are stored

# The next line has the name of the tree of the input data. It is
# optional if there is exactly one tree in the first input file.
ntuple   #name of the input tree

# The lines of the next block correspond to .root input files that
# contain the tree. In this case we use only one input file.
tutorials/hsimple.root  # this is the input file

# The next block is composed by lines that allow to configure the
# histograms. They have the following syntax:
# NAME = EXPRESSION if CUT
# which corresponds to chain->Draw("EXPRESSION >> NAME", "CUT")
# i.e. it will create a histogram called NAME and store it in
# file_output.root.
# "if CUT" is optional
hpx=px if px<-3   #first histogram
hpxpy=px:py    #second histogram

# End of the configuration file
