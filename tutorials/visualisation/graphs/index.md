A [TGraph](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph.html) is an object made of two arrays X and Y with n points each. ROOT can create TGraphs automatically by reading a text file (e.g. CSV), using a function, another TGraph, histogram, vectors, arrays, or even by adding pairs of points one by one.

In addition, ROOT offers multiple variations to basic TGraphs, such as:
- [TGraph2D](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph2D.html)
- [TGraph2DAsymmErrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph2DAsymmErrors.html)
- [TGraph2DErrrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph2DErrors.html)
- [TGraphAsymmErrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphAsymmErrors.html)
- [TGraphBentErrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphBentErrors.html)
- [TGraphDelaunay](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphDelaunay.html)
- [TGraphDelaunay2D](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphDelaunay2D.html)
- [TGraphErrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphErrors.html)
- [TGraphMultiErrors](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphMultiErrors.html)
- [TGraphPolar](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphPolar.html)
- [TGraphQQ](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphQQ.html)
- [TGraphSmooth](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphSmooth.html)
- [TGraphStruct](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphStruct.html)
- [TGraphTime](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphTime.html).

TGraphs are painted through the [TGraphPainter](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraphPainter.html) or [TGraph2DPainter](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTGraph2DPainter.html) classes. As a general remark, TGraphs are not binned, each point is painted individually.

The graph tutorials below are divided in groups of increasing complexity, starting with examples showing how to create, fill, and draw the different types of graphs.
