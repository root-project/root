/// Example of script showing how to divide a canvas
/// into adjacent subpads + axis labels on the top and right side
/// of the pads.
///
/// See the [Divide documentation](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTPad.html#a2714ddd7ba72d5def84edc1fbaea8658)
///
/// Note that the last 2 arguments in
///     `c1->Divide(2,2,0,0)`
/// define 0 space between the pads. With this, the axis labels where the pads
/// touch may be cut, as in this tutorial. To avoid this, either add some spacing
/// between pads (instead of 0) or change the limits of the plot in the pad (histos
/// in this tutorial). E.g. `h3` could be defined as
///     `TH2F *h3 = new TH2F("h3","test3",10,0,1,22,-1.1,1.1);`
/// but note that this can change the displayed axis labels (requiring SetNdivisions
/// to readjust).
///
/// SetLabelOffset changes the (perpendicular) distance to the axis. The label
/// position along the axis cannot be changed
