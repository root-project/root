   # Note: 
   # To have a better and dynamic view of any of these pads,
   # you can click-in the middle button of your mouse.
   # Then select "View with x3d" option in the VIEW menu of the Canvas.
   # Once in x3d, you are in wireframe mode by default.
   # You can switch to any of these other options:
   #   - Hidden Line mode by typing E
   #   - Solid mode by typing R
   #   - Wireframe mode by typing W
   #   - Stereo mode by clicking S (and you will need special glasses, though)
   #   - To leave x3d type Q
