\defgroup Tutorials Tutorials
\brief A collection of C++ macros, Python scripts and notebooks helping to learn ROOT by example.

You can execute the scripts in `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` (or sub-directories)
by setting your current directory in the script directory or from any
user directory with write access.

Several tutorials create new files. If you have write access to
the tutorials directory, the new files will be created in the tutorials
directory, otherwise they will be created in the user directory.

You can start by executing the standard ROOT demos with a session like:

```
  root > .x demos.C
```
or

```
  root > .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/demos.C
```

You can execute the standard ROOT graphics benchmark with

```
  root > .x benchmarks.C
```

or

```
  root > .x $ROOTSYS/tutorials/benchmarks.C
```

## Get started

If you have never used ROOT before and donâ€™t know where to start, we recommend that you first explore the [ROOT introductory course](https://github.com/root-project/student-course). You can also watch the recording of the course, but you should follow the material along on your PC. You also may want to have a look at the documentation of these modules:

- @ref tutorial_hist
- @ref tutorial_graphs
- @ref tutorial_fit
- @ref tutorial_tree
- @ref tutorial_ntuple
- @ref tutorial_dataframe
- @ref tutorial_roofit

The `$ROOTSYS/tutorials` directory includes several sub-directories:
