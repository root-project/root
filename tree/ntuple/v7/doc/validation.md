RNTuple Format and API Validation
=================================

This document is a stub.
It is meant to be edited during the RNTuple development phase until its transition into production.
The document should collect observables that need to be tested and verified
during the large-scale validation of RNTuple (we foresee test with petabyte-scale of volume and >10^5 files).

Checks
