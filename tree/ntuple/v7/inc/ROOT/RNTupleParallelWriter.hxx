\ingroup NTuple
\brief A writer to fill an RNTuple from multiple contexts

Compared to the sequential RNTupleWriter, a parallel writer enables the creation of multiple RNTupleFillContext (see
RNTupleParallelWriter::CreateFillContext).  Each fill context prepares independent clusters that are appended to the
common ntuple with internal synchronization.  Before destruction, all fill contexts must have flushed their data and
been destroyed (or data could be lost!).

For user convenience, RNTupleParallelWriter::CreateFillContext is thread-safe and may be called from multiple threads
in parallel at any time, also after some data has already been written.  Internally, the original model is cloned and
ownership is passed to a newly created RNTupleFillContext.  For that reason, it is recommended to use
RNTupleModel::CreateBare when creating the model for parallel writing and avoid the allocation of a useless default
REntry per context.

Note that the sequence of independently prepared clusters is indeterminate and therefore entries are only partially
ordered:  Entries from one context are totally ordered as they were filled.  However, there is no orderering with other
contexts and the entries may be appended to the ntuple either before or after other entries written in parallel into
other contexts.  In addition, two consecutive entries in one fill context can end up separated in the final ntuple, if
they happen to fall onto a cluster boundary and other contexts append more entries before the next cluster is full.

At the moment, the parallel writer does not (yet) support incremental updates of the underlying model. Please refer to
RNTupleWriter::CreateModelUpdater if required for your use case.
