\class ROOT::Experimental::RNTupleAnchor
\ingroup NTuple
\brief Representation of an RNTuple data set in a ROOT file

The class points to the header and footer keys, which in turn have the references to the pages (via page lists).
Only the RNTuple key will be listed in the list of keys. Like TBaskets, the pages are "invisible" keys.
Byte offset references in the RNTuple header and footer reference directly the data part of page records,
skipping the TFile key part.

In the list of keys, this object appears as "ROOT::Experimental::RNTuple".
It is the user-facing representation of an RNTuple data set in a ROOT file and
it provides an API entry point to an RNTuple stored in a ROOT file. Its main purpose is to
construct a page source for an RNTuple, which in turn can be used to read an RNTuple with an RDF or
an RNTupleReader.

For instance, for an RNTuple called "Events" in a ROOT file, usage can be
~~~ {.cpp}
auto f = TFile::Open("data.root");
auto ntpl = f->Get<ROOT::Experimental::RNTuple>("Events");

auto reader = RNTupleReader::Open(ntpl);
or
auto pageSource = ntpl->MakePageSource();
~~~
