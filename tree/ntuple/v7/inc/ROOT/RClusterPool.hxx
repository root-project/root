\brief Managed a set of clusters containing compressed and packed pages

The cluster pool steers the preloading of (partial) clusters. There is a two-step pipeline: in a first step,
compressed pages are read from clusters into a memory buffer. The second pipeline step decompresses the pages
and pushes them into the page pool. The actual logic of reading and unzipping is implemented by the page source.
The cluster pool only orchestrates the work queues for reading and unzipping. It uses two threads, one for
each pipeline step. The I/O thread for reading waits for data from storage and generates no CPU load. In contrast,
the unzip thread is supposed to submit multi-threaded, CPU heavy work to the application's task scheduler.

The unzipping step of the pipeline therefore behaves differently depending on whether or not implicit multi-threadin
is turned on. If it is turned off, i.e. in a single-threaded environment, the cluster pool will only read the
compressed pages and the page source has to uncompresses pages at a later point when data from the page is requested.
