<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Significantly improve performance of TTree Proxy.</li>
<li>Improve read performance of sub-branch containing vector of single types.</li>
<li>Fix TTree::LoadBasket to properly handle the (new) case where no basket is stored with the TTree object.</li>
<li>Fix the axis used for an histogram created by TTree::Draw for a branch of TString or std::string objects.</li>
<li>MakeProxy now correctly support branches that created with a leaflist with more than one leaf
(usually used for C-struct).</li>
<li>TTree::CloneTree and TChain::Merge in fast mode now can recover from some mismatch errors between
the input and output TTrees by falling back to using the 'slow' mode.  In particular this allow
a 'fast cloning' to handle files that requires schema evolution (albeit it is of course much slower).</li>
<li>Make sure that the TTreeCache is not attempting to cache (wrongly) the content of branches that are in an auxiliary files.</li>
<li>Make sure that FillBuffer does it work when the learning phase is over even if the entry number is 'low' for the 'current' file of a chain.</li>
<li>If TTree::SetEventList is called, TTree::GetEntryList no longer relinquish ownership of the automatically created TEntryList</li>
<li>Add the ability to see the TTree UserInfo list from the TBrowser</li>
<li>Fix the case of reading a TTree containing an 'old' class layout that contained a std::vector that is no longer part of the current class layout</li>
<li>Implement direct interfaces from TTree to the result of TSelector::Draw
  TTree:GetVal(int) and TTree::GetVar(int)</li>
<li>In TTree::ReadFile add the possibility to read multiple input files and add support for large/wide Trees definition.</li>
<li>Added support for "5-D" plotting.</li>
<li>Added support for std::bitset</li>
<li>Reduce the memory used by the mechanism keeping track of the entry of variables sizes within a basket (fEntryOffset).
The memory used now automatically decrease if the number of entries in the basket is less than 1/4 oflength of fEntryOffset.
Also the default length fEntryOffset can be set via TTree::SetDefaultEntryOffsetLen which can be optionially applied to the
existing branches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parallel Coordinates</h3>
<ul>
<li> Fix a memory leak. The <tt>TParallelCoord</tt> destructor was not called
     when the canvas used to draw it was closed.
</ul>
