<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restore support for IsAutoDelete in a TBranchElement (IsAutoDelete is an explicit request by the user to have the object deleted/newed each time GetEntry is called)</li>
<li>Allow .root in the name of directory in TChain::Add and TChain::AddFile (however in this case the root file must be ending .root)</li>
<li>Improve support for <i>circular</i> TTree friendship in LoadTree</li>
<li>Insure that the in-memory tree (not attached to a file) are saved in their new style (i.e. each basket saved separately) and prevent the printing of the misleading error message:
<pre>Error in : Cannot create key without file </pre></li>
<li>Repaired TTreeSQL:
The existing code was not compatible with the change made in TTree to reduce the number of baskets in memory.</li>

<li>If the TreeFriend is entered via a TTree*, properly detect that it is in the same file and do _not_ record the filename (since we will alway know where to find it.)ß</li>
<li>Add "," in the list of special characters replaced by "_" in the TTree::MakeClass
and TTree::MakeCode functions.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tree Viewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>In <tt>TParallelCoordVar</tt> the "average marker" for candle plots was not painted at
    the right place in case of horizontal view.
<li> Protection added in:
<tt>TParallelCoord::TParallelCoord(TTree* tree, Long64_t nentries)</tt>
          in case <tt>nentries &gt; tree-&gt;GetEstimate()</tt>
          in such case a warning is printed and <tt>fNentries</tt> is set to
          <tt>tree-&gt;GetEstimate()</tt>
          instead of <tt>nentries</tt>.

</ul>
