<h3>Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Restore support for IsAutoDelete in a TBranchElement (IsAutoDelete is an explicit request by the user to have the object deleted/newed each time GetEntry is called).</li>
<li>Allow .root in the name of directory in TChain::Add and TChain::AddFile (however in this case the root file must be ending .root.)</li>
<li>Improve support for <i>circular</i> TTree friendship in LoadTree.</li>
<li>Insure that the in-memory tree (not attached to a file) are saved in their new style (i.e. each basket saved separately) and prevent the printing of the misleading error message:
<pre>Error in : Cannot create key without file </pre></li>
<li>Repaired TTreeSQL:
The existing code was not compatible with the change made in TTree to reduce the number of baskets in memory.</li>

<li>If the TreeFriend is entered via a TTree*, properly detect that it is in the same file and do <I><B>not</B></I> record the filename (since we will alway know where to find it.)</li>
<li>Add "," in the list of special characters replaced by "_" in the TTree::MakeClass
and TTree::MakeCode functions.</li>

<li>The fast cloning now explicitly rejects trying to merge TTrees with different split level</li>
<li>The fast cloning now supports the case where one of the branch in the output tree in
not present and also supports the case where branch are not the same order.</li>
<li>New bit flag <tt>kMapObject</tt> [<tt>mybranch->ResetBit(kMapObject)</tt>] to explicitly disable the
    object registration during streaming within a branch (Use only if you are sure that there
    is not a pointer pointing back to the nesting object within this branch).
</li>
<li>Fix <tt>tree->Draw("s1.value");</tt>
   when the top level branch does not have a trailing dot
   (and hence the real branch name is only 'value').</li>
</ul>
<li>Fixed support for vector&lt;bool&gt; and vector&lt;string&gt; </li>
<li>Added support for top level object that do not inherit from TObject _AND_ have a custom streamer (like std::string and TString);</li>

<h3>Tree Viewer</h3>
<ul>
<li>In <tt>TParallelCoordVar</tt> the "average marker" for candle plots was not painted at
    the right place in case of horizontal view.
<li> Protection added in:
<tt>TParallelCoord::TParallelCoord(TTree* tree, Long64_t nentries)</tt>
          in case <tt>nentries &gt; tree-&gt;GetEstimate()</tt>
          in such case a warning is printed and <tt>fNentries</tt> is set to
          <tt>tree-&gt;GetEstimate()</tt>
          instead of <tt>nentries</tt>.

</ul>
