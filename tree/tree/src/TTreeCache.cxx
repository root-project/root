## <a name="motivation"></a>Motivation: why having a cache is needed?

When writing a TTree, the branch buffers are kept in memory.
A typical branch buffersize (before compression) is typically 32 KBytes.
After compression, the zipped buffer may be just a few Kbytes.
The branch buffers cannot be much larger in case of TTrees with several
hundred or thousand branches.

When writing, this does not generate a performance problem because branch
buffers are always written sequentially and, thanks to OS optimisations,
content is flushed to the output file when a few MBytes of data are available.
On the other hand, when reading, one may hit performance problems because of
latencies e.g imposed by network.
For example in a WAN with 10ms latency, reading 1000 buffers of 10 KBytes each
with no cache will imply 10s penalty where a local read of the 10 MBytes would
take about 1 second.

The TreeCache tries to prefetch all the buffers for the selected branches
in order to transfer a few multi-Megabytes large buffers instead of many
multi-kilobytes small buffers. In addition, TTreeCache can sort the blocks to
be read in increasing order such that the file is read sequentially.

Systems like xrootd, dCache or httpd take advantage of the TTreeCache in
reading ahead as much data as they can and return to the application
the maximum data specified in the cache and have the next chunk of data ready
when the next request comes.

### Are there cases for which the usage of TTreeCache is detrimental for performance?
Yes, some corner cases. For example, when reading only a small fraction of all
entries such that not all branch buffers are read.

## <a name="description"></a>General Description
This class acts as a file cache, registering automatically the baskets from
the branches being processed via direct manipulation of TTrees or with tools
such as TTree::Draw, TTree::Process, TSelector, TTreeReader and RDataFrame
when in the learning phase. The learning phase is by default 100 entries.
It can be changed via TTreeCache::SetLearnEntries.

The usage of a TTreeCache can considerably improve the runtime performance at
the price of a modest investment in memory, in particular when the TTree is
accessed remotely, e.g. via a high latency network.

For each TTree being processed a TTreeCache object is created.
This object is automatically deleted when the Tree is deleted or
when the file is deleted.
The user can change the size of the cache with the TTree::SetCacheSize method
(by default the size is 30 Megabytes). This feature can be controlled with the
environment variable `ROOT_TTREECACHE_SIZE` or the TTreeCache.Size option.
The entry range for which the cache is active can also be set with the
SetEntryRange method.

## <a name="changesbehaviour"></a>Changes of behavior when using TChain and TEventList

The usage of TChain or TEventList have influence on the behaviour of the cache:

- Special case of a TChain
  Once the training is done on the first Tree, the list of branches
  in the cache is kept for the following files.

- Special case of a TEventlist
  if the Tree or TChain has a TEventlist, only the buffers
  referenced by the list are put in the cache.

The learning phase is started or restarted when:
   - TTree automatically creates a cache.
   - TTree::SetCacheSize is called with a non-zero size and a cache
     did not previously exist
   - TTreeCache::StartLearningPhase is called.
   - TTreeCache::SetEntryRange is called
        * and the learning is not yet finished
        * and has not been set to manual
        * and the new minimun entry is different.

The learning period is stopped (and prefetching is started) when:
   - TTreeCache::StopLearningPhase is called.
   - An entry outside the 'learning' range is requested
     The 'learning range is from fEntryMin (default to 0) to
     fEntryMin + fgLearnEntries.
   - A 'cached' TChain switches over to a new file.


## <a name="cachemisses"></a>Self-optimization in presence of cache misses

The TTreeCache can optimize its behavior on a cache miss. When
miss optimization is enabled (see the SetOptimizeMisses method),
it tracks all branches utilized after the learning phase which caused a cache
miss.
When one cache miss occurs, all the utilized branches are be prefetched
for that event. This optimization utilizes the observation that infrequently
accessed branches are often accessed together.
An example scenario where such behavior is desirable, is an analysis where
a set of collections are read only for a few events in which a certain
condition is respected, e.g. a trigger fired.

### Additional memory and CPU usage when optimizing for cache misses
When this mode is enabled, the memory dedicated to the cache can increase
by at most a factor two in the case of cache miss.
Additionally, on the first miss of an event, we must iterate through all the
"active branches" for the miss cache and find the correct basket.
This can be potentially a CPU-expensive operation compared to, e.g., the
latency of a SSD.  This is why the miss cache is currently disabled by default.

## <a name="examples"></a>Example usages of TTreeCache

A few use cases are discussed below. A cache may be created with automatic
sizing when a TTree is used:

In some applications, e.g. central processing workflows of experiments, the list
of branches to read is known a priori. For these cases, the TTreeCache can be
instructed about the branches which will be read via explicit calls to the TTree
or TTreeCache interfaces.
In less streamlined applications such as analysis, predicting the branches which
will be read can be difficult. In such cases, ROOT I/O flags used branches
automatically when a branch buffer is read during the learning phase.

In the examples below, portions of analysis code are shown.
The few statements involving the TreeCache are marked with `//<<<`

### ROOT::RDataFrame and TTreeReader Examples

If you use RDataFrame or TTreeReader, the system will automatically cache the
best set of branches: no action is required by the user.

### TTree::Draw Example

The TreeCache is automatically used by TTree::Draw. The method knows
which branches are used in the query and it puts automatically these branches
in the cache. The entry range is also inferred automatically.

### TTree::Process and TSelectors Examples

The user must enable the cache and tell the system which branches to cache
and also specify the entry range. It is important to specify the entry range
in case only a subset of the events is processed to avoid wasteful caching.

#### Reading all branches

~~~ {.cpp}
    TTree *T;
    f->GetObject(T, "mytree");
    auto nentries = T->GetEntries();
    auto cachesize = 10000000U; // 10 MBytes
    T->SetCacheSize(cachesize); //<<<
    T->AddBranchToCache("*", true);    //<<< add all branches to the cache
    T->Process("myselector.C+");
    // In the TSelector::Process function we read all branches
    T->GetEntry(i);
    // ... Here the entry is processed
~~~

#### Reading a subset of all branches

In the Process function we read a subset of the branches.
Only the branches used in the first entry will be put in the cache
~~~ {.cpp}
    TTree *T;
    f->GetObject(T, "mytree");
    // We want to process only the 200 first entries
    auto nentries=200UL;
    auto efirst = 0;
    auto elast = efirst+nentries;
    auto cachesize = 10000000U; // 10 MBytes
    TTreeCache::SetLearnEntries(1);  //<<< we can take the decision after 1 entry
    T->SetCacheSize(cachesize);      //<<<
    T->SetCacheEntryRange(efirst,elast); //<<<
    T->Process("myselector.C+","",nentries,efirst);
    // In the TSelector::Process we read only 2 branches
    auto b1 = T->GetBranch("branch1");
    b1->GetEntry(i);
    if (somecondition) return;
    auto b2 = T->GetBranch("branch2");
    b2->GetEntry(i);
    ... Here the entry is processed
~~~
### Custom event loop

#### Always using the same two branches

In this example, exactly two branches are always used: those need to be
prefetched.
~~~ {.cpp}
    TTree *T;
    f->GetObject(T, "mytree");
    auto b1 = T->GetBranch("branch1");
    auto b2 = T->GetBranch("branch2");
    auto nentries = T->GetEntries();
    auto cachesize = 10000000U; //10 MBytes
    T->SetCacheSize(cachesize);     //<<<
    T->AddBranchToCache(b1, true);  //<<< add branch1 and branch2 to the cache
    T->AddBranchToCache(b2, true);  //<<<
    T->StopCacheLearningPhase();    //<<< we do not need the system to guess anything
    for (auto i : TSeqL(nentries)) {
       T->LoadTree(i); //<<< important call when calling TBranch::GetEntry after
       b1->GetEntry(i);
       if (some condition not met) continue;
       b2->GetEntry(i);
       if (some condition not met) continue;
       // Here we read the full event only in some rare cases.
       // There is no point in caching the other branches as it might be
       // more economical to read only the branch buffers really used.
       T->GetEntry(i);
       ... Here the entry is processed
    }
~~~
#### Always using at least the same two branches

In this example, two branches are always used: in addition, some analysis
functions are invoked and those may trigger the reading of other branches which
are a priori not known.
There is no point in prefetching branches that will be used very rarely: we can
rely on the system to cache the right branches.
~~~ {.cpp}
    TTree *T;
    f->GetObject(T, "mytree");
    auto nentries = T->GetEntries();
    auto cachesize = 10000000;   //10 MBytes
    T->SetCacheSize(cachesize);   //<<<
    T->SetCacheLearnEntries(5);   //<<< we can take the decision after 5 entries
    auto b1 = T->GetBranch("branch1");
    auto b2 = T->GetBranch("branch2");
    for (auto i : TSeqL(nentries)) {
       T->LoadTree(i);
       b1->GetEntry(i);
       if (some condition not met) continue;
       b2->GetEntry(i);
       // At this point we may call a user function where a few more branches
       // will be read conditionally. These branches will be put in the cache
       // if they have been used in the first 10 entries
       if (some condition not met) continue;
       // Here we read the full event only in some rare cases.
       // There is no point in caching the other branches as it might be
       // more economical to read only the branch buffers really used.
       T->GetEntry(i);
       .. process the rare but interesting cases.
       ... Here the entry is processed
    }
~~~

##  <a name="checkPerf"></a>How can the usage and performance of TTreeCache be verified?

Once the event loop terminated, the number of effective system reads for a
given file can be checked with a code like the following:
~~~ {.cpp}
    printf("Reading %lld bytes in %d transactions\n",myTFilePtr->GetBytesRead(),  f->GetReadCalls());
~~~

Another handy command is:
~~~ {.cpp}
myTreeOrChain.GetTree()->PrintCacheStats();
~~~
