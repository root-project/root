const auto fullUsageText =
   "Description:\n"
   " rootreadspeed is a tool used to help identify bottlenecks in root analysis programs\n"
   " by providing an idea of what throughput you can expect when reading ROOT files in\n"
   " certain configurations.\n"
   " \n"
   " It does this by providing information about the number of bytes read from your files,\n"
   " how long this takes, and the different throughputs in MB/s, both in total and per thread.\n"
   "\n"
   "\n"
   "Compressed vs Uncompressed Throughput:\n"
   " Throughput speeds are provided as compressed and uncompressed - ROOT files are usually\n"
   " saved in compressed format, so these will often differ. Compressed bytes is the total\n"
   " number of bytes read from TFiles during the readspeed test (possibly including meta-data).\n"
   " Uncompressed bytes is the number of bytes processed by reading the branch values in the TTree.\n"
   " Throughput is calculated as the total number of bytes over the total runtime (including\n"
   " decompression time) in the uncompressed and compressed cases.\n"
   "\n"
   "\n"
   "Interpreting results:\n"
   " \n"
   " There are three possible scenarios when using rootreadspeed, namely:\n"
   " \n"
   "  -The 'Real Time' is significantly lower than your own analysis runtime.\n"
   "    This would imply your actual application code is dominating the runtime of your analysis,\n"
   "    ie. your analysis logic is taking up the time.\n"
   "    \n"
   "    The best way to decrease the runtime would be to optimize your code, attempt to parallelize\n"
   "    it onto multiple threads if possible, or use a machine with a more performant CPU.\n"
   "  \n"
   "  \n"
   "  -The 'Real Time' is significantly higher than 'CPU Time / number of threads'*.\n"
   "    If the real time is higher than the CPU time per core it implies the reading of data is the\n"
   "    bottleneck, as the CPU cores are wasting time waiting for data to arrive from your disk/drive\n"
   "    or network connection in order to decompress it.\n"
   "    \n"
   "    The best way to decrease your runtime would be transferring the data you need onto a faster\n"
   "    storage medium (ie. a faster disk/drive such as an SSD, or connecting to a faster network\n"
   "    for remote file access), or to use a compression algorithm with a higher compression ratio,\n"
   "    possibly at the cost of the decompression rate.\n"
   "    \n"
   "    Changing the number of threads is unlikely to help, and in fact using too many threads may\n"
   "    degrade performance if they make requests to different regions of your local storage. \n"
   "    \n"
   "    * If no '--threads' argument was provided this is 1, otherwise it is the minimum of the value\n"
   "      provided and the number of threads your CPU can run in parallel. It is worth noting that -\n"
   "      on shared systems or if running other heavy applications - the number of your own threads\n"
   "      running at any time may be lower than the limit due to demand on the CPU.\n"
   "  \n"
   "  \n"
   "  -The 'Real Time' is similar to 'CPU Time / number of threads'\n"
   "  -AND 'Compressed Throughput' is lower than expected for your storage medium:\n"
   "    This would imply that your CPU threads aren't decompressing data as fast as your storage medium\n"
   "    can provide it, and so decompression is the bottleneck.\n"
   "    \n"
   "    The best way to decrease your runtime would be to utilise a system with a faster CPU, or make use\n"
   "    use of more threads when running, or use a compression algorithm with a higher decompression rate,\n"
   "    possibly at the cost of some extra file size.\n"
   "\n"
   "\n"
   "A note on caching:\n"
   " If your data is stored on a local disk, the system may cache some/all of the file in memory after it is\n"
   " first read. If this is realistic of how your analysis will run - then there is no concern. However, if\n"
   " you expect to only read files once in a while - and as such the files are unlikely to be in the cache -\n"
   " consider clearing the cache before running rootreadspeed.\n"
   "  (On Linux this can be done by running 'echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches' as a superuser)\n";
