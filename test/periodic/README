ROOT GUI demo showing a very nice periodic system and element selection panel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use "make" to compile the project.

After make you will have a program XSGui. Execute this program and select
from the menubar the option "Element/Reaction". To get the periodic system
click on the little icon in the top right of the "Select Element/Reaction"
panel.

For H (isotope 1) and Pb (isotopes 208 and natural) the reactions
can be plotted. Select a reaction and click on "Ok" or "Execute".

This is a code snapshot of a project in development so not much more can
be done, but it shows execellent use of the ROOT GUI.
