"Radiation length:\n"
"High-energy electrons predominantly lose energy in matter by\n"
"bremsstrahlung, and high-energy photons by e + e - pair production.\n"
"The characteristic amount of matter traversed for these related\n"
"interactions is called the radiation length X 0, usually measured\n"
"in g cm - 2 . It is the mean distance over which a high-energy\n"
"electron loses all but 1/e of its energy by bremsstrahlung, and\n"
"the e-folding distance for pair production by a high-energy photon\n"
"is 97 X0. It is also the appropriate scale length for describing\n"
"high-energy electromagnetic cascades.\n"
"\n"
"Electromagnetic cascades:\n"
"When a high-energy electron or photon is incident on a thick absorber,\n"
"it initiates an electromagnetic cascade as pair production and\n"
"bremsstrahlung generate more electrons and photons with lower energy.\n"
"The longitudinal development is governed by the high-energy part of\n"
"the cascade, and therefore scales as the radiation length in the\n"
"material. Electron energies eventually fall below the critical energy,\n"
"and then dissipate their energy by ionization and excitation rather\n"
"than by the generation of more shower particles.\n"
"\n"
"Energy loss by electrons:\n"
"At low energies electrons and positrons primarily lose energy by\n"
"ionization, although other processes (Moller scattering, Bhabha\n"
"scattering, e + annihilation) contribute. \n"
"While ionization loss rates rise logarithmically with energy,\n"
"bremsstrahlung losses rise nearly linearly (fractional loss is\n"
"nearly independent of energy), and dominates above a few tens of\n"
"MeV in most materials Ionization loss by electrons and positrons\n"
"differs from loss by heavy particles because of the kinematics, spin,\n"
"and the identity of the incident electron with the electrons which\n"
"it ionizes.\n"
"\n"
"Muon energy loss at high energy:\n"
"At sufficiently high energies, radiative processes become more\n"
"important than ionization for all charged particles. For muons\n"
"and pions in materials such as iron, this 'critical energy' occurs\n"
"at several hundred GeV. Radiative effects dominate the energy loss\n"
"of energetic muons found in cosmic rays or produced at the newest\n"
"accelerators.\n"
"These processes are characterized by small cross sections, hard\n"
"spectra, large energy fluctuations, and the associated generation\n"
"of electromagnetic and (in the case of photonuclear interactions)\n"
"hadronic showers. As a consequence, at these energies the treatment\n"
"of energy loss as a uniform and continuous process is for many\n"
"purposes inadequate.\n";
