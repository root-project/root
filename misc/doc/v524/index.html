<h2>Quick Look plugin for MacOS X</h2>

New Quick Look plugin that allows quick inspection of the content
of a ROOT file.
<p>
Quick Look is available on MacOS X since version 10.5 (Leopard). To use QL
select an file icon in the Finder and hit the space bar. For all file types
supported by QL you will get a window showing the file content, for file types
not supported you will get a generic window showing some basic file info.
<p>
The idea of QL is that file content can be shown without the heavy application
startup process. Generating a QL view of a ROOT file depends on the size of the
file, but generally it is a quick operation.
<p>
Get the binary for the ROOTQL plugin from:
<pre>
   ftp://root.cern.ch/root/ROOTQL.tgz
</pre>
<p>
To install the plugin, after untarring the above file, just drag the bundle
ROOTQL.qlgenerator to /Library/QuickLook (global, i.e. for all users on a
system) or to ~/Library/QuickLook (local, this user only) directory.
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.
<p>
To build from source, get it from svn using:
<pre>
   svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/misc/rootql rootql
</pre>
<p>
Open the ROOTQL project in Xcode and click on "Build" (make sure the Active
Build Configuration is set the "Release"). Copy the resulting
plugin from build/Release to the desired QuickLook directory.

<h2>SpotLight plugin for MacOS X</h2>

This is a Spotlight plugin that allows ROOT files to be indexed by SL.
Once indexed SL can find ROOT files based on the names and titles of the
objects in the files.
<p>
Spotlight is available on MacOS X since version 10.4 (Tiger). To use SL
select the SL icon on the top right of the menubar and type in a search text.
<p>
Get the binary for the ROOTSL plugin from:
<pre>
   ftp://root.cern.ch/root/ROOTSL.tgz
</pre>
<p>
To install the plugin, after untarring the above file, just drag the bundle
ROOTSL.mdimporter to /Library/Spotlight (global, i.e. for all users on a
system) or to ~/Library/Spotlight (local, this user only) directory.
You may need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist.
<p>
To build from source, get it from svn using:
<pre>
   svn co http://root.cern.ch/svn/root/trunk/misc/rootsl rootsl
</pre>
<p>
Open the ROOTSL project in Xcode and click on "Build" (make sure the Active
Build Configuration is set the "Release"). Copy the resulting
plugin from build/Release to the desired QuickLook directory.
