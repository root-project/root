<h3>Misc</h3>
A new directory <b>minicern</b> has been introduced. This directory contains
the zebra and hbook files required to build the <b>h2root</b> and <b>g2root</b> utilities.
These small files remove dependencies on the old CERNLIB files.
<b>h2root</b> and <b>g2root</b> as well as the library <b>libHbook</b> are
automatically built when configuring ROOT and a Fortran compiler found in the system.
