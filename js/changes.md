   One could parse ROOT JSON, read binary ROOT files (local and remote) and produce SVG.
2. Implement dropping of TTree object on the geometry drawing.
   This automatically invokes extract_geo_tracks() function, which
   should extract TGeoTracks from provided TTree.
   Example can be found in demo/alice_esd.js and in api.htm.
3. Implement projection of geometry on given plane.
   One could reuse drawing of geometry in other div (should be drawn with main option).
   In control GUI one could change position of the projection plane
4. One of the TGeo drawing can be assigned as main. When same object drawn next time,
   its drawing will be derived from the main. Useful for geometry projections.
   Also all tracks and hits will be imported from main drawing.

8. Introduce JSROOT.GEO.build function to create three.js model for
   any supported TGeo class. Such model can be inserted in any three.js scene
   independent from normal JSROOT drawings.

   objects rendered after opaque and without writing depth buffer. Provide different
   methods to produce render order for transparent objects.
10. Let specify initial zoom factor for geometry like opt=zoom50.
11. Support also TPolyMarker3D class in geo painter.
12. Implement TGeoScaledShape.
13. Limit complexity of composite shape. If it has too many components, only most left is used.

    Allows to combine 2D and 3D objects in same PNG image
15. Improve MathJax.js output. It scales correctly in Firefox, makes correct alignment
    and works significantly faster.
16. When creating image in SVG format, correctly convert url("#id") references
17. Use latest three.js r85
18. Fix 'transpXY' URL parameter handling - it was used as opacity, but opacity=1-transparency

   divided on 2,3 and 1 sub-frames.
5. One could enable status line where current tooltip info will be shown
6. Improve enlarge functionality - now works with all layouts

15. Support direct reading of objects from sub-sub-directories.
16. Introduce demo.htm, which demonstrates online usage of JSROOT.
17. One could use demo.htm directly with THttpServer providing address like:
     <http://localhost:8080/jsrootsys/demo/demo.htm?addr=../../Files/job1.root/hpx/root.json.gz&layout=3x3>
18. Also for online server process url options like 'item', 'items', 'layout'
19. Possibility to generate URL, which reproduces opened page with layout and drawn items

### August 2014
1. All communication between server and browser done with JSON format.
2. Fix small error in dtree.js - one should always set
   last sibling (_ls) property while tree can be dynamically changed.
3. In JSRootCore.js provide central function, which handles different kinds
   of XMLHttpRequest.  Use only async requests, also when getting file header.
4. Fully reorganize data management in file/tree/directory/collection hierarchical
   display. Now complete description collected in HPainter class and decoupled from
   visualization, performed with dTree.js.
5. Remove all global variables from the code.
6. Automatic scripts/style loading handled via JSROOT.loadScript() function.
   One can specify arbitrary scripts list, which asynchronously loaded by browser.
7. Method to build simple GUI changed and more simplified :). The example in index.htm.
   While loadScript and AssertPrerequisites functions moved to JSROOT, one
   can easily build many different kinds of GUIs, reusing provided JSRootCore.js functions.
8. In example.htm also use AssertPrerequisites to load necessary scripts.
   This helps to keep code up-to-date even by big changes in JavaScript code.
9. Provide monitoring of online THttpServer with similar interface as for ROOT files.
10. Fix several errors in TKey Streamer, use member names as in ROOT itself.
11. Keep the only version identifier JSROOT.version for JS code
12. One can specify in JSROOT.AssertPrerequisites functionality which is required.
    One could specify '2d', 'io' (default) or '3d'.
13. Use new AssertPrerequisites functionality to load only required functionality.
14. When displaying single element, one could specify draw options and monitor property like:
        <http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpxpy/draw.htm?opt=col&monitor=2000>
     Such link is best possibility to integrate display into different HTML pages,
     using `<iframe/>` tag like:
        `<iframe src="http://localhost:8080/Files/job1.root/hpx/draw.htm"`
          `style="width: 800px; height:600px"></iframe>`
15. Remove 'JSROOTIO.' prefix from _typename. Now real class name is used.
16. Use in all scripts JSROOT as central 'namespace'
17. Introduce context menu in 3D, use it for switch between 2D/3D modes
18. Use own code to generate hierarchical structure in HTML, replace dtree.js which is
    extremely slow for complex hierarchies. Dramatically improve performance for
    structures with large (~1000) number of items.
19. Deliver to the server title of the objects, display it as hint in the browser.
20. Better handling of special characters in the hierarchies - allows to display
    symbols like ' or " in the file structure.

### July 2014
1. Migration to d3.v3.js and jQuery v2.1.1
2. Fix errors in filling of histogram statbox
3. Possibility of move and resize of statbox, title, color palete
4. Remove many (not all) global variables
5. Example with direct usage of JSRootIO graphics
6. Example of inserting ROOT graphics from THttpServer into `<iframe></iframe>`

### May 2014
1. This JSRootIO code together with THttpServer class included
   in ROOT repository

### March 2014
1. Introduce TBuffer class, which plays similar role
   as TBuffer in native ROOT I/O. Simplifies I/O logic,
   reduce duplication of code in many places, fix errors.
   Main advantage - one could try to keep code synchronous with C++.
2. Avoid objects cloning when object referenced several times.
3. Treat special cases (collection, arrays) in one place.
   This is major advantage, while any new classes need to be implemented only once.
4. Object representation, produced by JSRootIO is similar to
   objects, produced by TBufferJSON class. By this one can exchange
   I/O engine and use same JavaSctript graphic for display.
5. More clear functions to display different elements of the file.
   In the future functions should be fully separated from I/O part
   and organized in similar way as online part.
6. Eliminate usage of gFile pointer in the I/O part.
7. Provide TBufferJSON::JsonWriteMember method. It allows to stream any
   selected data member of the class. Supported are:
   basic data types, arrays of basic data types, TString, TArray classes.
   Also any object as data member can be streamed.
8. TRootSniffer do not creates sublevels for base classes
