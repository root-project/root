## About

ROOT is a unified software package for the storage, processing, and analysis of 
scientific data: from its acquisition to the final visualization in form of highly 
customizable, publication-ready plots. It is reliable, performant and well supported,
easy to use and obtain, and strives to maximize the quantity and impact of scientific 
results obtained per unit cost, both of human effort and computing resources.

ROOT provides a very efficient storage system for data models, 
that demonstrated to scale at the Large Hadron Collider experiments: Exabytes 
of scientific data are written in columnar ROOT format.
ROOT comes with histogramming capabilities in an arbitrary number of 
dimensions, curve fitting, statistical modelling, minimization, to allow
the easy setup of a data analysis system that can query and process the data
interactively or in batch mode, as well as a general parallel processing
framework, RDataFrame, that can considerably speed up an analysis, taking 
full advantage of multi-core and distributed systems.

ROOT is performance critical software written in C++ and enables rapid prototyping 
powered by a unique C++ compliant interpreter called Cling. 
Cling also enables performant C++ type introspection which is a building block of automatic 
interoperability with Python. Thanks to its dynamic Python bindings, leveraging the cppyy technology, 
ROOT offers efficient, on-demand C++/Python interoperability in a uniform cross-language 
execution environment.

ROOT fully embraces open-source, it's made with passion by its community,
for the benefit of its community.
