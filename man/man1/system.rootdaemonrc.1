.SH NAME
system.rootdaemonrc, .rootdaemonrc \- access control directives for ROOT daemons
.SH LOCATIONS
.nf
.B ROOTDAEMORC, $HOME/.rootdaemonrc
.B /etc/root/system.rootdaemonrc, $ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootdaemonrc
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents the format of directives specifying access control
directives for ROOT daemons. These directives are read from a text file whose
full path is taken from the environment variable \fBROOTDAEMONRC\fR.
If such a variable in undefined, the daemon looks for a file named
\fB.rootdaemonrc\fR in the $HOME directory of the user starting the daemon;
if this file does not exists either, the file
\fBsystem.rootdaemonrc\fR, located under \fB/etc/root\fR or \fB$ROOTSYS/etc\fR, is used.
If none of these file exists (or is readable), the daemon makes use of a default
built-in directive derived from the configuration options of the installation.

.SH "FORMAT"
.TP
.B *
lines starting with '#' are comment lines.
.TP
.B *
hosts can specified either with their name (e.g. pcepsft43), their FQDN (e.g. pcepsft43.cern.ch) or their IP address (e.g. 137.138.99.73).
.TP
.B *
directives applying to all host can be specified either by 'default' or '*'
.TP
.B *
the '*' character can be used in any field of the name to indicate a set of machines or domains, e.g. pcepsft*.cern.ch applies to all 'pcepsft' machines in the domain 'cern.ch'. (to indicate all 'lxplus' machines you should use 'lxplus*.cern.ch' because internally the generic lxplus machine has a real name of the form lxplusnnn.cern.ch; you can also use 'lxplus' if you don't care about domain name checking).
.TP
.B *
a whole domain can be indicated by its name, e.g. 'cern.ch', 'cnaf.infn.it' or '.ch'
.TP
.B *
truncated IP address can also be used to indicate a set of machines; they are interpreted as the very first or very last part of the address; for example, to select 137.138.99.73, any of these is valid: '137.138.99', '137.138', '137`, '99.73'; or with wild cards: '137.13*' or '*.99.73`; however, '138.99' is invalid because ambiguous.
.TP
.B *
the information following the name or IP address indicates, in order of preference, the short names or the internal codes of authentication methods accepted for requests coming from the specified host(s); the ones implemented so far are:

   Method                           nickname    code

   UsrPwd                            usrpwd       0

Methods not specified explicitly are not accepted.

.TP
.B *
Lines ending with '\' are followed by additional information for the host on the next line; the name of the host should not be repeated.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
Valid examples:

.TP
.B default              none
All requests are denied unless specified by dedicated directives.

.TP
.B default              0
Authentication mechanisms allowed by default are 'usrpwd' (code 0)

.TP
.B 137.138.             0
Authentication mechanisms allowed from host in the domain 137.138. (cern.ch) are 'usrpwd' (code 0)

.TP
.B lxplus*.cern.ch      0:qwerty:uytre
Requests from the lxplus cluster from users 'qwerty' and 'uytre' can authenticate using 'usrpwd'.

.TP
.B pcep*.cern.ch        0:-qwerty
Requests from the pcep*.cern.ch nodes can authenticate using 'usrpwd' when accessing the 'rootd' daemon ; user 'qwerty' cannot use 'usrpwd'.

.\" Revision 1.1  2004/12/15 12:37:43  rdm
.\" From Gerri:
.\" 1) New files:
.\"  .1 build/package/rpm/root-rootd.spec.in

.\"
.\"  .2 build/package/common/root-rootd.dscr
.\"
.\"     short and long descriptions used in the previous file
.\"
.\"  .3 config/rootd.in
.\"
.\"     Skeleton for the startup script to be created under etc; the
.\"     variable which depends on the configuration directives is
.\"     the location of the executable to run (i.e the installation
.\"     prefix). This file is to be moved to /etc/rc.d/init.d/ on RH
.\"     (or equivalent position on other versions of Linux).
.\"
.\"  .4 man/man1/system.rootdaemonrc.1
.\"
.\"     man page for system.rootdaemonrc and related files
.\"
.\"
.\" 2) Patched files:
.\"
.\"  .1 Makefile
.\"
.\"     add new target 'rootdrpm' with the rules to create the specs file
.\"
.\"  .2 configure
.\"
.\"     add creation of etc/rootd from the skeleton in config/rootd.in
.\"
.\"  .3 config/Makefile.in
.\"
.\"     add variable ROOTDRPMREL with the RPM release version (default 1);
.\"     this can be changed on command line whn creating the spec file
.\"
.\"  .4 config/rootdaemonrc.in
.\"
.\"     update fir 'sockd' and correct a few typos
