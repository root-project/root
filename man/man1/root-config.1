.SH NAME
root-config \- ROOT utility for your Makefiles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B root-config
.I "[options]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIroot-config\fP is a tool that is used to configure and determine
the compiler and linker flags that should be used to compile
and link programs that use \fIROOT\fP.
.RS 
.nf 

CPPFLAGS  += $(shell root-config \-\-cflags)
LDLIBS    += $(shell root-config \-\-libs)

.RE
in your Makefile to use the built-in rules of GNU make. For GUIs, replace \fI\-\-libs\fR by \fI\-\-glibs\fR.
.PP
You may also find the \fIautomake\fR(1), \fIautoconf\fR(1), and
\fIlibtool\fR(1) macro file \fI/usr/share/aclocal/root.m4\fR
useful.  If that macro file isn't installed where \fIaclocal\fR will
find it, copy the contents to your local \fIacinclude.m4\fR file.  In
the directories you use \fBROOT\fR libraries, have in your
\fIMakefile.am\fR file: 
.RS 
.nf 

lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
pkginclude_HEADERS      = Foo.h
noinst_HEADERS          = FooCint.h
libFoo_la_SOURCES       = Foo.cxx FooCint.cxx   
libFoo_la_LDFLAGS       = \-version-info 1:0 \-R @ROOTLIBDIR@
libFoo_la_LDADD         = \-lCore \-lCint @ROOTAUXLIBS@

BUILT_SOURCES           = FooCint.cxx FooCint.h 

AM_CPPFLAGS             = \-I@ROOTINCDIR@
AM_LDFLAGS              = \-L@ROOTLIBDIR@

.RE
where you should substitute \fBFoo\fR with whatever, and list the
appropriate source files in the \fB_SOURCES\fR variable. In you
\ficonfigure.in\fR file, put:
.RS
.nf

AC_PROG_CC
AC_PROG_CXX
ROOT_PATH
AM_PROG_LIBTOOL

.fi
.RE
along with any other macros you may need. 
.PP
Note that the \fBROOT_PATH\fR macro takes three optional arguments:
the minimal \fBROOT\fR version to use, action if \fBROOT\fR is found,
and action if \fBROOT\fR isn't found.  Some examples are 
.RS
.nf

ROOT_PATH(3.03/05, , AC_MSG_ERROR(Your ROOT version is too old))
ROOT_PATH(, AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT))

.fi
.RE
For example, if you want to compile some part of your source tree
conditionally on wether \fBROOT\fR is present or not, you can put in
your \fIconfigure.in\fR file 
.RS
.nf

ROOT_PATH(,
[
  AC_DEFUN(HAVE_ROOT)
  have_root=yes  
])
AM_CONDITIONAL(GOT_ROOT, test "x$have_root" = "xyes")

.fi
.RE
And then in some \fIMakefile.am\fR
.RS
.nf

EXTRA_SOURCES		= root_dependent_source.cc
if GOT_ROOT
LIBFOOXTRA              = root_dependent_source.cc
else
LIBFOOXTRA              =
endif

lib_LTLIBRARIES         = libFoo.la
libFoo_la_SOURCES	= Foo.cc  $(LIBFOOXTRA)

.SH OPTIONS 
.TP 
.B \-\-help
Give a short list of options available, and exit
.TP

.TP
.BI \-\-prefix =<prefix>
If no arguments are given, reports where \fBROOT\fR is installed. With
an argument of =\fI<prefix>\fR, set the base of the subsequent options
to \fI<prefix>\fR. If \fB\\-\-exec-prefix\fR is passed with an argument,
it overrides the argument given to \fB\\-\-prefix\fR for the
library path. 
.TP
.BI \-\-exec-prefix =<prefix>
If no argument is given, report where the libraries are installed. If
an argument is given, use that as the installation base directory for
the libraries. This option does not affect the include path. 
.TP
.B \-\-libdir
Print the directory where the ROOT libraries are installed. 
.TP
.B \-\-incdir
Print the directory where the ROOT headers are installed. 
.TP

.TP
.B \-\-evelibs
As above, but also output for the graphics libraries and Eve libraries.
.TP
.B \-\-cflags
Output a line suitable for compiling a source file against the
\fBROOT\fR header (class declararion) files.
.TP
.B \-\-new 
Put the \fBlibNew.so\fR library in the library lists.  This option
\fImust\fR be given before options \fB\-\-libs\fR and \fB\-\-glibs\fR.
