.SH NAME
proofserv \- PROOF (The Parallel ROOT Facility)
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Using \fBPROOF\fI (The \fIP\fRarallel \fIROO\fRT \fIF\fRacility) one
can analyze trees in parallel on a cluster of computers. The
\fBPROOF\fR system consists also of the \fIxproofd\fR(1) daemon.
.PP
\fIxproofd\fR takes care of user authentication and overlays itself
then with the desired version of the \fIproofserv\fR(1)
executable.
.PP
The \fIproofserv\fR(1) is a basically the same as the \fBROOT\fR
interactive module \fIroot\fR(1), except that it reads its commands
from a socket instead of from the terminal.
.PP
Since it is a remote server it will not do graphics and therefore is
not linked with any graphics libraries (Motif, X11, etc.).
.PP
\fBproofserv\fR is started by the daemon \fBproofd\fR(1) on request by
the user.  It is not a command to be executed by the user directly.
.PP
Note, that if \fBproofserv\fR is passed any arguments, it will use the
\fBlibProofx\fB interface, rather than the standard \fBlibProof\fR
interface.
