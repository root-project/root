.SH NAME
h2root \- convert PAW HBOOK files to ROOT files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h2root 
.I file.hbook  file.root [compress] [tolower] [lrecl]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B h2root 
you can use to convert your 
.B HBOOK/PAW 
histograms or ntuples files into 
.B ROOT 
files. To use this program, you type the shell script command: 
.sp 1
.RS
.B h2root 
.I hbookfile 
.I rootfile
.RE
.sp 1
If you do not specify the second parameter, a file name is
automatically generated for you. If 
.I hbookfile 
is of the form 
.IR file.hbook , 
then the 
.B ROOT 
file will be 
called 
.IR file.root . 
.PP
This program converts 
.B HBOOK 
histograms into 
.B ROOT 
objects of the class 
.IR TH1F . 
.B HBOOK 
profile histograms are converted into 
.B ROOT 
profile histograms (see class 
.IR TProfile ). 
.B HBOOK
row-wise and column-wise ntuples are automatically converted to 
.B ROOT 
Trees(see 
.IR TTree ). 
Some 
.B HBOOK 
column-wise ntuples may not be fully converted in case one of the
columns is an array with fix dimensions (eg. `var[6]') or is a
multi-dimensional array.  
.PP
.B HBOOK 
integer identifiers are converted into 
.B ROOT 
named objects by prefixing the integer identifier with the letter `h'
if the identifier is a positive integer and by `h_' if it is a
negative integer identifier.  
.PP 
In case of row-wise or column-wise ntuples, each column is converted
to a branch of a Tree.  
.B 
Note that 
.B h2root 
is able to convert 
.B HBOOK
files containing several levels of sub-directories. 
.B 
Once you have converted your file, you can look at it and draw
histograms or process ntuples using the 
.B ROOT 
interactive module. You can also use the 
.B ROOT 
browser (see 
.IR TBrowser )
to inspect this file.  
.PP 
The chapter 
.I How to read a Tree 
explains two ways to read a Tree. ROOT includes the function 
.I TTree::MakeCode 
to automatically generate the code for a skeleton analysis
function. With 
.SH OPTIONS
